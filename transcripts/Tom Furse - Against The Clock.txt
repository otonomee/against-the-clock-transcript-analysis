1970-01-01 00:00:00: Hi, I'm Tom Furze. I'm going to be going against the clock for FAT Magazine. I'm only going
1970-01-01 00:00:13: to be using the Teenage Engineering OP-1 and pretty much just using a sample I recorded
1970-01-01 00:00:20: off Classical FM last night. Alright, so I'm going to get some kind of background sounds going first.
1970-01-01 00:00:50: Then I'm going to loop that up.
1970-01-01 00:01:08: Okay, and then I'm just going to sort of use the same sample slower for another loop.
1970-01-01 00:01:38: Wait for that to end.
1970-01-01 00:02:38: And now I'm just going to do like a pass over the whole thing.
1970-01-01 00:05:38: Okay, so now I'm going to kind of use a different sample I got. Sample some sounds. I'm just going to see where that fits with what I just did.
1970-01-01 00:08:08: Okay, I'm just going to kind of just play around with what's recorded now because you can turn stuff backwards in this and do all kinds of things. Play it slower.
1970-01-01 00:09:08: I'm going to try playing it backwards.
1970-01-01 00:10:38: My brother bought one and I was quite keen to borrow it and my girlfriend actually borrowed it and we just never gave it back. Sorry, Freddie.
1970-01-01 00:11:01: Yeah, I've just been using it and I decided to try and make a bunch of little pieces of music for a radio show that I do. Yeah, it kind of snowballed into making an album on it.
1970-01-01 00:11:11: The recording interface is a lot more like a four-track cassette player than it is like a modern audio workstation. That requires a little bit of a different way of thinking about things and approaching things.
1970-01-01 00:11:23: You know, you can't really meticulously edit things. You can edit things, but it's pretty brutal. It's weird. It doesn't really work like anything else that I had used.
1970-01-01 00:11:36: So like sort of 10 years experience with synthesizers and making music were kind of sort of more or less irrelevant. There wasn't actually that much backup there. It sounds a lot bigger and deeper than it looks.
