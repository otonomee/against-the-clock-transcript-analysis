1970-01-01 00:00:00: Hello, my name is Sebastian Muller. Today I'm going against the clock for Fact TV.
1970-01-01 00:10:00: Holy smoke!
1970-01-01 00:10:30: 10 minutes is really short for me. When I'm in the studio I always jam and I like to jam
1970-01-01 00:10:49: really long sequences and kind of lose track of time. So for me having that time and going
1970-01-01 00:10:55: against the clock is a little challenge, but it was really fun. When I make music,
1970-01-01 00:11:00: I normally kind of, it's a process of jamming myself in when I feel like, wow, now something
1970-01-01 00:11:07: special and then I record a few takes. So it's a lot about kind of finding that space for myself,
1970-01-01 00:11:12: together with the gear and then jam. I've been playing so much violin and piano in my life and
1970-01-01 00:11:19: that's how I started with music and later on in my teens electronic
1970-01-01 00:11:25: instruments came into my life. And the last 10-15 years the violin hasn't been so much part of my
1970-01-01 00:11:32: life and the last two-three years I really felt like, okay, now is the time to get it back. So
1970-01-01 00:11:39: it's slowly coming back into my studio and my touring. So it felt like a good opportunity to
1970-01-01 00:11:46: to have a little taste for it.
