1970-01-01 00:00:00: Hello, I'm Paul Hartnall from Orbital and I'm about to go against the clock with Facts
1970-01-01 00:00:09: Magazine.
1970-01-01 00:00:10: Okay, I'm going.
1970-01-01 00:00:12: Okay, so I am now going to try and make a track...
1970-01-01 00:00:15: It's not well named leftie.
1970-01-01 00:00:16: Out in ten minutes out of loads of politicians waffling.
1970-01-01 00:00:21: That's just the fairly obvious.
1970-01-01 00:00:22: That's all I'm going to use, just these sounds.
1970-01-01 00:00:24: I've got a bit of drum machine to back me up if I need to.
1970-01-01 00:00:27: I've started to make some... put some politicians into here.
1970-01-01 00:00:32: Where are they?
1970-01-01 00:00:34: It's a Theresa May snare drum, Boris Johnson kick drum.
1970-01-01 00:00:40: Don't know who that is, but anyway, let's get cracking and see what happens.
1970-01-01 00:00:46: Nope.
1970-01-01 00:00:47: Hang on, it would be help if I had a click drum.
1970-01-01 00:00:54: Click track.
1970-01-01 00:00:56: I'm going to click.
1970-01-01 00:01:10: Alright, start with something like that and see what happens.
1970-01-01 00:01:25: Okay, let's have a look then.
1970-01-01 00:01:44: I've got...
1970-01-01 00:01:51: That's a Nigel Farage kind of bass pad using granulator.
1970-01-01 00:01:57: Let's see what comes up.
1970-01-01 00:01:58: Hang on.
1970-01-01 00:02:14: Alright, so we've got something there.
1970-01-01 00:02:32: Let's see what happens.
1970-01-01 00:02:44: Quantize.
1970-01-01 00:03:02: Okay, what else have we got?
1970-01-01 00:03:31: Another sound I've prepared earlier.
1970-01-01 00:03:34: A Theresa May lead sound.
1970-01-01 00:04:01: Let's see what happens.
1970-01-01 00:04:31: I can hear something developing.
1970-01-01 00:04:46: Hang on.
1970-01-01 00:04:47: That angle of two.
1970-01-01 00:05:17: Start again.
1970-01-01 00:05:18: Start again.
1970-01-01 00:05:19: Do it again.
1970-01-01 00:05:20: Stop.
1970-01-01 00:05:21: You stopped?
1970-01-01 00:05:22: Alright.
1970-01-01 00:05:23: Record.
1970-01-01 00:05:24: There.
1970-01-01 00:05:25: Okay.
1970-01-01 00:05:27: Okay, let's see what happens.
1970-01-01 00:05:50: Mixing out.
1970-01-01 00:06:45: Use that then.
1970-01-01 00:06:49: That's actually a sound I recorded in New Haven Fort.
1970-01-01 00:06:56: Blowing a train whistle in a big military tunnel.
1970-01-01 00:06:59: Turned into a blippy noise.
1970-01-01 00:07:03: That's it.
1970-01-01 00:08:03: We're doing for time.
1970-01-01 00:08:09: Two minutes left.
1970-01-01 00:08:10: Shock it.
1970-01-01 00:09:33: Okay.
1970-01-01 00:10:03: Is that it?
1970-01-01 00:10:15: Wow.
1970-01-01 00:10:16: Shocking amount of time.
1970-01-01 00:10:18: There you go.
1970-01-01 00:10:19: That's what I did.
1970-01-01 00:10:27: This morning I just ran off a few recordings of politicians talking.
1970-01-01 00:10:32: Mostly British ones.
1970-01-01 00:10:33: And thought, well that's it.
1970-01-01 00:10:35: That's going to be my oscillator sound source.
1970-01-01 00:10:37: And I hustled together some presets.
1970-01-01 00:10:39: Some ideas of sounds.
1970-01-01 00:10:41: Which is really lucky I did.
1970-01-01 00:10:43: Because I was originally thinking this morning.
1970-01-01 00:10:45: I would just make every sound up as we go along.
1970-01-01 00:10:48: Which I reckon would have got nothing done.
1970-01-01 00:10:51: If I had done that, it's incredible.
1970-01-01 00:10:53: Just, you know.
1970-01-01 00:10:54: Of course, you're always nervous when you've got some kind of,
1970-01-01 00:10:57: like a time constraint or, you know,
1970-01-01 00:10:59: you've got to achieve something in ten minutes.
1970-01-01 00:11:01: There's always the fear of failing.
1970-01-01 00:11:02: But actually once I got started I just thought we just got to go.
1970-01-01 00:11:05: You know, you start getting lost in the composition.
1970-01-01 00:11:07: And that kind of thing.
1970-01-01 00:11:09: So that was good.
1970-01-01 00:11:10: But it did mean I didn't keep my eye on the time.
1970-01-01 00:11:13: I mean I checked it expecting it to be,
1970-01-01 00:11:15: well I read it as two minutes.
1970-01-01 00:11:17: And thought, oh we've only had two minutes.
1970-01-01 00:11:19: No, we'd had eight minutes.
1970-01-01 00:11:20: So two minutes left.
1970-01-01 00:11:22: I think voices have got a funny kind of, you know,
1970-01-01 00:11:24: you can get most things out of voices.
1970-01-01 00:11:25: You can make whole compositions out of it.
1970-01-01 00:11:27: So it's kind of going along that line.
1970-01-01 00:11:29: Okay, just voices.
1970-01-01 00:11:30: So that's limited for a start.
1970-01-01 00:11:32: And then politicians, why not make some sense out of a load of old rubbish.
1970-01-01 00:11:35: Do you know what I mean?
1970-01-01 00:11:36: You know, it's like they're mostly sort of just talking crap.
1970-01-01 00:11:39: So, yeah, ten minutes.
1970-01-01 00:11:41: See if I can sort them out and make some sense of it.
1970-01-01 00:11:44: I don't know if I achieved that.
1970-01-01 00:11:46: But, you know, it certainly sounded prettier than when they went in.
