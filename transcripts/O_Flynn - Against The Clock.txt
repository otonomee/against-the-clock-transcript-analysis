1970-01-01 00:00:00: We're in my parents' attic at the moment. This is where I make the majority of my music.
1970-01-01 00:00:11: I've got some drums on a record that I think I'm going to try and work with and then just
1970-01-01 00:00:16: add a few other samples and try and get the profit on there. Yeah, use a bit of the modular
1970-01-01 00:00:21: stuff as well. That's kind of what I'm aiming to do.
1970-01-01 00:00:26: I don't really know what style it would be at the moment. I don't know. I don't know
1970-01-01 00:00:29: yet. We'll just have to see. Hi, this is O'Flynn and I'm going against the clock for fact.
1970-01-01 00:06:29: I might not have time to do this, but...
1970-01-01 00:10:29: That went very, very quickly. My hands were shaking at the start as well.
1970-01-01 00:11:00: Yeah, I think it went alright. Ten minutes is just... I've never really made stuff in
1970-01-01 00:11:06: ten minutes before. I take months and months and months to get a good idea and I go through
1970-01-01 00:11:12: maybe 50 to 100 ideas before one of them is usable. That wasn't natural at all for me,
1970-01-01 00:11:18: so the only thing I could change would just be keep working. Keep working at it, I think.
1970-01-01 00:11:24: But yeah, I thought it went okay though for ten minutes. Yeah. Quite a lot of the time
1970-01-01 00:11:28: I try and start with samples and then you can build something around a sample and that
1970-01-01 00:11:34: way it's quite hard if you start with a drum beat first or whatever and then try and fit
1970-01-01 00:11:37: a sample into that. I find that a bit more difficult, so yeah, I try and start with something.
1970-01-01 00:11:43: The sample doesn't have to be on vinyl. It could be off YouTube or CD or whatever. Quite
1970-01-01 00:11:49: a lot of the time it is off vinyl though because there is just a lot of weird music and sounds
1970-01-01 00:11:54: that you can buy on vinyl. Where would I go to find a good sample? Generally record
1970-01-01 00:11:58: stores and it's always the record... It's never really the super expensive records where
1970-01-01 00:12:03: the really good... For me, where the really good samples are, it's usually the one that's
1970-01-01 00:12:08: kind of forgotten and sort of in the corner and will be low price because of the quality
1970-01-01 00:12:16: of stuff. I've found the best samples from just, yeah, from looking hard and it's in
1970-01-01 00:12:23: unexpected places. That's why it's worth listening to a lot of music even if the record
1970-01-01 00:12:30: cover is terrible or something. There might be one sound on there. It might be 20 tracks
1970-01-01 00:12:36: of absolutely awful music and then one sound can give you just complete gold. There's a
1970-01-01 00:12:40: place called Ben's Records. I think it's called Ben's Records. Yeah, Ben's Records in Guildford
1970-01-01 00:12:45: which is just so much of... It's all second hand and just stacks and stacks and stacks
1970-01-01 00:12:50: of it. Yeah, I found Desmond's Empire sample there and that was one of the most important.
1970-01-01 00:12:57: It was probably the best sample I've ever found I think. And then there's also, I mean,
1970-01-01 00:13:02: Sounds of the Universe in London's just got loads of great old music and they have original
1970-01-01 00:13:08: African music there. The record I used just there came from Leon, Emil Records, but there's
1970-01-01 00:13:16: also Sofa Records in Leon where I bought a load of records from which are all, again,
1970-01-01 00:13:22: really good for world music and stuff. This is the cover. Yeah, it's kind of... The backside's
1970-01-01 00:13:29: kind of blurred so maybe if you put 3D glasses on it might look 3D. It kind of looks like
1970-01-01 00:13:35: that effect. Yeah, I mean, vocals can come from anywhere. The one I just used in that
1970-01-01 00:13:41: was a Brandy, just a cappella which you can get on these downloads of websites and stuff,
1970-01-01 00:13:47: but sometimes you can find a really good vocal sample on records and it will be like when the
1970-01-01 00:13:53: music drops out and there might be a clip of... But there is actually a great vocal sample on this
1970-01-01 00:13:58: as well, but I want to use it for something else. Okay, so I started with the drum loop off the record,
1970-01-01 00:14:07: which is this.
1970-01-01 00:14:11: And yeah, you just find like a bar or two of a loop.
1970-01-01 00:14:17: So it goes again and then you cut it and all I do is I do this all the time. I cut... This is what
1970-01-01 00:14:23: happens if you start with the sample. You cut at the first beat, which is where the scissor tool,
1970-01-01 00:14:28: and then you find the beat where it's about to start getting cut there and then you just drag
1970-01-01 00:14:32: the tempo until what you've done, which is an exact loop, fits the bar of this. So the tempo of
1970-01-01 00:14:41: this is 118.25. So you get like sort of more precise tempos because you're going to... This
1970-01-01 00:14:49: probably wasn't recorded to a click track. Then I added some just stuff to like... We're going with
1970-01-01 00:14:55: this. Added the kick,
1970-01-01 00:15:00: claps. These claps are a logic loop, so they just snap to the time. Like Ableton does that
1970-01-01 00:15:08: anyway with other stuff, but logic loops, if you set it to logic loop, it can just go in time. So
1970-01-01 00:15:14: the claps and then just a hi-hat on the off. Very simple. Just gives it slightly more energy.
1970-01-01 00:15:23: I started with an arp on the prophet and then I ran it through
1970-01-01 00:15:28: the morphogen here. That created this kind of almost granular effect.
1970-01-01 00:15:37: And I just loop that because there's no real time of that. You can just sort of cut it wherever.
1970-01-01 00:15:41: That's not synced up or anything. And then I put in just some chords from the prophet,
1970-01-01 00:15:47: which I kind of guess all the chords I play, but I was just playing the black notes, which generally
1970-01-01 00:15:57: work together, whatever you hit. Something I definitely do when working not under 10 minute
1970-01-01 00:16:06: time limit is to work out proper, well, better chords, but I just didn't have the time to do it.
1970-01-01 00:16:12: So I just had to go with whatever I randomly did. It kind of works. It sounds nice with that
1970-01-01 00:16:18: kind of granular crystallizer sort of thing. And then I put in some little effects on the D-Fam.
1970-01-01 00:16:27: Just this.
1970-01-01 00:16:31: And that, the D-Fam is already midi synced to the computer, so it's automatically just going to be
1970-01-01 00:16:37: in time with that 118.25. The little 808 thing there is also going to be in that exact time. So
1970-01-01 00:16:46: the electron rhythm, which I didn't use, but you know, so you could have a synth jam and it'd all
1970-01-01 00:16:50: be synced up, which is super helpful. And then the last thing I did frantically and quite messily is
1970-01-01 00:16:58: put in this vocal sample, which is turning up slightly. It's just a brandy vocal sample.
1970-01-01 00:17:05: Before I would actually probably take it out. Now I've heard it back. It adds a little bit more of a
1970-01-01 00:17:11: melody to it. There's not really a melody in here. So, so yeah, and then that's, that's actually it.
1970-01-01 00:17:16: And then I just tried to do a bit of a structure, but didn't really have time to finish that.
