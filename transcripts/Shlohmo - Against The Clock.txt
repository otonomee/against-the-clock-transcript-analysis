1970-01-01 00:00:00: What's up? This is Shlomo and I'm going against the clock today for FACT TV. Let's fucking
1970-01-01 00:00:11: do it. Alright, 10 minutes to make a fucking song. Usually takes me four years to make
1970-01-01 00:00:22: a song so let's see what I can do in 10 minutes. Okay, I got some kits laid out already. I'm
1970-01-01 00:00:52: got some drums.
1970-01-01 00:00:59: Alright, let's loop that shit for now.
1970-01-01 00:01:17: I'm gonna take out that one, that sounds stupid. Alright, I got a little fucking drum shit going
1970-01-01 00:01:36: to keep some time. Alright, I've been thinking about this melody for a few days. Let's see
1970-01-01 00:02:06: Nope.
1970-01-01 00:02:36: Cool. That last one sounded fine.
1970-01-01 00:03:06: So it's not perfect so what I'm gonna do is stretch this little motherfucker out. You know
1970-01-01 00:03:19: what I'm saying? Get that good fucking pro formance on it. That was the one, that's why
1970-01-01 00:03:49: Alright, loop that shit.
1970-01-01 00:04:49: Cool.
1970-01-01 00:04:58: Got a little of that.
1970-01-01 00:05:19: Wow, we halfway through already.
1970-01-01 00:05:36: Fuck.
1970-01-01 00:05:39: I'm gonna grab this fucking Tommy Wright sample.
1970-01-01 00:05:44: Normally what I would do is remake something like this.
1970-01-01 00:05:53: But I do not have time, so what I'm gonna do is sample one of my favorite sounding Tommy Wright songs.
1970-01-01 00:06:02: Just to get this weird fucking gritty cowbell out of it.
1970-01-01 00:06:07: Let's hear how it sounds.
1970-01-01 00:06:08: So this is the original song.
1970-01-01 00:06:10: So I slowed it down.
1970-01-01 00:06:18: Let's loop it.
1970-01-01 00:06:20: Pitch it down a little bit.
1970-01-01 00:06:40: Alright, I'm gonna make a little fucking drum loop.
1970-01-01 00:06:57: Alright, so I kind of have an idea of what I want, so I'm just gonna draw it in.
1970-01-01 00:07:57: Alright, so that's cool for now.
1970-01-01 00:08:10: I'm also gonna add some little things from another drum kit to make it slap a little harder.
1970-01-01 00:08:21: Where are we at here?
1970-01-01 00:08:36: Yeah, that's it.
1970-01-01 00:08:44: Where the fuck did that go?
1970-01-01 00:09:14: Let's get some hi-hat sounds.
1970-01-01 00:09:44: Oh, we got 18 seconds left.
1970-01-01 00:09:57: Fuck.
1970-01-01 00:09:58: Alright, let's make a real quick structure here.
1970-01-01 00:10:02: I'm not even gonna be able to do it.
1970-01-01 00:10:04: Let's try.
1970-01-01 00:10:06: Dope.
1970-01-01 00:10:08: We out.
1970-01-01 00:10:12: Done.
1970-01-01 00:10:14: That was your own god.
1970-01-01 00:10:22: Fucking frightening to work in 10 minutes.
1970-01-01 00:10:32: Usually I take like a month or so to get like a good idea and then many months more of finessing
1970-01-01 00:10:40: and whatever the fuck to like get it to the place where I want it to be.
1970-01-01 00:10:45: I had an idea in mind so that was easier, but if I didn't, you would have gotten like
1970-01-01 00:10:51: one synth line idea maybe in 10 minutes.
1970-01-01 00:10:55: Mostly what I'm using is this computer obviously, an Ableton.
1970-01-01 00:11:00: Just an Ableton man, I don't know anything else.
1970-01-01 00:11:03: Pretty ignorant.
1970-01-01 00:11:04: Then for the main synth line I was using this Moog Grandmother over here.
1970-01-01 00:11:10: It's got that pretty weirdo analog mono sound so I like to mess with it for that and it
1970-01-01 00:11:17: also has this like spring reverb that makes everything sound cool shitty.
1970-01-01 00:11:21: Then for the bass line I was using this Prophet 8.
1970-01-01 00:11:25: Gets some good rumbly bass shit if you can finesse it.
1970-01-01 00:11:29: Drums and shit, I was like using a bunch of packs that I've kind of put together from
1970-01-01 00:11:36: random rap kits and drum machines and shit and I've just kind of distressed them and
1970-01-01 00:11:42: EQ'd them all pretty specifically so stuff that I use quite frequently.
1970-01-01 00:11:49: And then this Tommy Wright, the third sample.
1970-01-01 00:11:52: Tommy Wright's massive inspiration to me.
1970-01-01 00:11:55: His recordings are so perfectly tape shitty and distorted for like old 808 stuff and I
1970-01-01 00:12:04: always try and mimic it in my music.
1970-01-01 00:12:07: And what I'll do is I'll use fucking drum machines and record them to tape and bounce
1970-01-01 00:12:14: them back but obviously for the time limits I just sampled some Tommy.
1970-01-01 00:12:22: It's nothing better really.
