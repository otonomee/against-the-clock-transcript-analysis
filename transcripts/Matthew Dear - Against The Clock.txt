1970-01-01 00:07:17: I'm sorry
1970-01-01 00:07:49: I turn back inside, that's what you want me to find
1970-01-01 00:08:09: There's one way up and that way must look into you
1970-01-01 00:08:19: You say there's one way up to my love
1970-01-01 00:08:25: One way is to bring this touch to you
1970-01-01 00:08:29: Let's hope that you say I'm the one that you'll take
1970-01-01 00:08:33: I'm the one that you'll take
1970-01-01 00:08:43: I'm the one that you'll take
1970-01-01 00:08:49: I'm the one that you'll take
1970-01-01 00:08:56: I'm the one that you'll take
1970-01-01 00:09:02: I'm the one that you'll take
1970-01-01 00:09:09: I'm the one that you'll take
1970-01-01 00:10:16: What was it like working with the time restrictions?
1970-01-01 00:10:23: It was very restricting.
1970-01-01 00:10:25: No, actually it was very freeing, to be honest with you.
1970-01-01 00:10:27: If I think about it, it got to a point where I was thinking like, it can't be only five minutes in the past.
1970-01-01 00:10:32: I was able to get into some sort of alternate headspace, which I think is the best place to go to when you try to start writing music.
1970-01-01 00:10:41: Yeah, it was actually pretty cool.
1970-01-01 00:10:43: I enjoyed where I went, mentally.
1970-01-01 00:10:45: I used what you see here and what you saw in the video.
1970-01-01 00:10:49: My main hub was an OctaTrack MK2 by Electron.
1970-01-01 00:10:53: A little bit of modular stuff for some weird sample effects.
1970-01-01 00:10:56: I ran my vocals through an Eventide Harmonizer, Pitchfactor pedal, which I think the guitar was actually going through as well.
1970-01-01 00:11:02: Some delay as well.
1970-01-01 00:11:05: A fun little toy that's become kind of a main staple of my live show, which is the Boss RC-505 Loopstation.
1970-01-01 00:11:14: Geared more toward the kind of vocalist battle type style stuff.
1970-01-01 00:11:20: But in terms of what it can do and how easily it can do it, you'd be surprised how many loopers don't really just loop the push of a button.
1970-01-01 00:11:28: That's the BAM from OTO, O-T-O Machines.
1970-01-01 00:11:30: Awesome stuff there.
1970-01-01 00:11:32: Great algorithmic reverb.
1970-01-01 00:11:34: And last but not least, the Bastel Time Machine Alternate Reality Flux Capacitor Switcher.
1970-01-01 00:11:42: That thing is nutty. It's one of those ones where you turn the knob and things just go into outer space.
1970-01-01 00:11:47: I like it. It's on the guitar.
1970-01-01 00:11:49: And I ran the guitar through the Electron analog heat MK1.
1970-01-01 00:11:53: That's how I roll.
1970-01-01 00:11:55: And it was good.
1970-01-01 00:11:56: And that's everything that I used.
1970-01-01 00:11:57: Oh, and my garage. My White Penguin.
1970-01-01 00:11:58: Which is a new model. Not a classic White Penguin.
1970-01-01 00:12:03: But it's classic to me because I've been looking at that guitar for ages.
1970-01-01 00:12:06: And I finally bought it.
1970-01-01 00:12:07: And I call it her Lucy. Short for Lucifer.
1970-01-01 00:12:11: What's my favorite against the clock?
1970-01-01 00:12:13: It's hard to pick one. It would be unfair.
1970-01-01 00:12:15: Because there have been so many.
1970-01-01 00:12:17: And the cool thing about watching videos like that,
1970-01-01 00:12:21: and against the clocks, and working on remixes, and working with friends and strangers,
1970-01-01 00:12:27: is you always get some little piece of information that you didn't really have before in the musical process.
1970-01-01 00:12:34: I love going to YouTube and things like that to watch how other people work sometimes.
1970-01-01 00:12:42: Because it can be the simplest thing.
1970-01-01 00:12:44: Like, oh, that's how you lay out a track on a tempo grid.
1970-01-01 00:12:50: But that's how you program your bass notes.
1970-01-01 00:12:52: Something so simple that has been in front of your face the whole time.
1970-01-01 00:12:56: Just kind of is apparent with somebody else.
1970-01-01 00:12:59: And vice versa. You share information.
1970-01-01 00:13:02: You learn. And you get samples. And booty bags.
1970-01-01 00:13:06: I like working with other people. And I like watching other people work.
