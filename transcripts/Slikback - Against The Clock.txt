1970-01-01 00:00:00: Hi, my name is Slick Park and I'm going against the clock for Fact Magazine.
1970-01-01 00:00:09: A bit nervous but mostly okay.
1970-01-01 00:00:12: I'm excited to see what will come out.
1970-01-01 00:00:14: A full truck, a three minute truck, maybe like a few hours but something interesting,
1970-01-01 00:00:23: I can definitely do it in ten minutes.
1970-01-01 00:00:26: But something interesting, something hopefully interesting enough that you haven't heard
1970-01-01 00:00:32: it before, I hope.
1970-01-01 00:00:34: And here I go.
1970-01-01 00:10:26: That's it.
1970-01-01 00:10:29: Yeah.
1970-01-01 00:10:32: That's it.
1970-01-01 00:10:35: Yeah.
1970-01-01 00:10:38: I didn't think it would turn out like this but I kind of like it.
1970-01-01 00:10:54: It's interesting.
1970-01-01 00:10:55: I don't think I've ever done this before and it was a good learning experience.
1970-01-01 00:11:20: Definitely adds pressure but in a way you kind of know what you're doing.
1970-01-01 00:11:25: You kind of have to just know what you're doing.
1970-01-01 00:11:30: I don't know how to describe it but just making a bit freely.
1970-01-01 00:11:34: I just end up kind of experimenting more with less time.
1970-01-01 00:11:41: I don't know if that makes sense but I experimented more with less time than I would with a lot of time.
1970-01-01 00:11:47: I honestly didn't think I would like it this much but I really like it.
1970-01-01 00:11:52: I've learnt a lot from this truck which I'll push forward to other trucks.
