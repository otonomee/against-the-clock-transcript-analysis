1970-01-01 00:00:00: We're in my studio in Kensal Rise. It's kind of an old building. It's been here since the
1970-01-01 00:00:10: sort of 90s. I moved in not so long ago and sort of set it up in the way that I like to
1970-01-01 00:00:18: create music and I feel a bit nervous actually for Against the Clock because it's kind of
1970-01-01 00:00:24: a bit of a mystery isn't it really. But you know it's always good to have these sorts
1970-01-01 00:00:28: of challenges. I didn't really prep too much for it. I kind of know the sounds that I sort
1970-01-01 00:00:34: of use with the synths and stuff and I'm just going to roll with that really and see where
1970-01-01 00:00:39: it takes me. I quite like this idea of not knowing where I'm going to go and what's going
1970-01-01 00:00:44: to happen really. And that's kind of the way I make music really. Very rarely do I set
1970-01-01 00:00:50: out to kind of create one specific sound. I'll be influenced by the sounds around me
1970-01-01 00:00:57: that you know and ideas that come into my head. So you know I've prepared some bits but not the
1970-01-01 00:01:05: full Monty. And it usually takes me about you know I'd say maybe a couple of days to get the
1970-01-01 00:01:16: full length track and then I'll spend the rest of the week or something like that on the production
1970-01-01 00:01:23: of it. Hey I'm Georgia and I'm going Against the Clock for Facts.
1970-01-01 00:01:35: Okay.
1970-01-01 00:01:42: Okay.
1970-01-01 00:01:49: Let's go start with the bass drum.
1970-01-01 00:02:24: Okay.
1970-01-01 00:02:29: Okay.
1970-01-01 00:02:53: Okay and then we want that little guy there, so we'll take him to there, that's it, and
1970-01-01 00:03:09: then we'll just reel in on that.
1970-01-01 00:06:13: And then we'll take that bit, because that bit was good, this bit wasn't good, okay,
1970-01-01 00:06:38: okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay,

1970-01-01 00:09:31: Okay, let's get a bit of snare in there. Okay, okay, how long?
1970-01-01 00:09:46: How long? A minute and a half now. Oh really? Wow! It just, well maybe I'll, maybe I'll
1970-01-01 00:10:01: forget that actually.
1970-01-01 00:10:46: Oh...
1970-01-01 00:11:16: Oh yeah!!!
1970-01-01 00:11:25: Damn you!
1970-01-01 00:11:37: I'm so proud of you!
1970-01-01 00:11:51: I thought I was going to get a lot more done in ten minutes but in the end I think I've
1970-01-01 00:12:04: ended up with a solid idea which I could then go on and add some vocals to. I really like
1970-01-01 00:12:10: the synth line that I've come up with and I feel like it's got some potential. I think
1970-01-01 00:12:17: I would have programmed the drums a little bit more in that first couple of minutes,
1970-01-01 00:12:22: like added some drums. But this is like, I don't know whether I'm thinking of finishing
1970-01-01 00:12:27: a track in ten minutes. I think maybe it just would have been nice if I had a bit more time
1970-01-01 00:12:31: to spend on the drums and then I could have perhaps quickly chopped that and put it into
1970-01-01 00:12:37: a rough structure and then that would have given me free time to kind of develop the
1970-01-01 00:12:42: synth line. But I think as like developing an idea it's kind of quite solid. I just used
1970-01-01 00:12:49: what I use in my studio basically. I used the OB-6, Dave Smith OB-6. Then I used the
1970-01-01 00:12:58: Roland SH-101 which I recently purchased, which I'm really happy about. And I used the Nordwave.
1970-01-01 00:13:06: Then I used Logic Pro X because that's the DAW that I use. And that's it really. Oh,
1970-01-01 00:13:13: and it's a TAR guitar and an EBO which is somewhere down there. And I was going to use
1970-01-01 00:13:20: a little bit of vocal but I didn't get around to doing that. But I, you know, I mainly,
1970-01-01 00:13:27: on all my recordings I use real synths really. I don't really use Logix inboards synths. I use
1970-01-01 00:13:38: outboard stuff. So this is everything that I'd use in my day to day work in the studio.
1970-01-01 00:13:44: Okay, so what I did was I got a kick drum up that I liked and then processed a kick drum.
1970-01-01 00:13:51: I wanted it to be four on the floor so I just, yep,
1970-01-01 00:13:58: programmed that in. And then using the OB-6 and I have patches on there that I've made
1970-01-01 00:14:06: through years of having an OB-6. I just got a melody or not a melody, a synth line up.
1970-01-01 00:14:14: And I kind of like this one.
1970-01-01 00:14:21: And that's how generally I'll write a song really. It will start with a synth or a piano
1970-01-01 00:14:30: and then some kind of form of rhythm helping drive it.
1970-01-01 00:14:35: And then I felt like it needed the SH. It needed like a driving bass line so I put the SH-101 on
1970-01-01 00:14:42: over it.
1970-01-01 00:14:54: And then with a lot of my productions or songs, there's some, I'll build up some textures and
1970-01-01 00:15:02: layers. So I went to the Nord Way for this.
1970-01-01 00:15:12: And I felt like it needed some chords so I don't know, for some reason I went to strings.
1970-01-01 00:15:30: And with the Nord strings I added a bit of EQ. I just took some mid out and
1970-01-01 00:15:35: got rid of some bass on it. And yeah, basically with the strings I didn't want
1970-01-01 00:15:43: I took a bit of the EQ, took a bit mid out and so it didn't clash with the SH-101 too much.
1970-01-01 00:15:55: And then with the main synth line.
1970-01-01 00:16:07: And then I tried to add a bit of satire guitar with some Ebo on it.
1970-01-01 00:16:12: A few wrong notes in there but actually sort of adds to the character.
1970-01-01 00:16:31: I should add I actually started with a BPM that I wanted to
1970-01-01 00:16:44: start with. I chose a 120 for a reason because it sounds good with four on the floor.
1970-01-01 00:16:50: I was heading into a bit of a kind of housey pop song. I would now add a melody over the
1970-01-01 00:16:56: top of this. Perhaps take the satire guitar out. Maybe write a vocal over the top of this.
1970-01-01 00:17:04: Maybe take the Nord out.
1970-01-01 00:17:09: And I'd sort of start to build it up with then adding the Nord Way.
1970-01-01 00:17:21: And then maybe the chorus is
1970-01-01 00:17:27: Yeah so I'd start to think about structure. But that was it really. I would have wanted to have
1970-01-01 00:17:33: added way more but 10 minutes went by very fast. I think my advice for new producers is to
1970-01-01 00:17:44: I mean just be kind of open to instrumentation. When I was
1970-01-01 00:17:51: younger and I was learning about producing I wasn't just purely learning on one instrument.
1970-01-01 00:18:00: I would always encourage people to be a bit more open to not just being on the computer.
1970-01-01 00:18:10: Get yourself a four track cassette recorder and play around with actually physically
1970-01-01 00:18:15: recording stuff. I think just have fun with it. It's fun. And I think when you're physically
1970-01-01 00:18:22: doing stuff there is that mad professor element to it. And that's what I love here. I've got
1970-01-01 00:18:28: everything at arm's length and I want to be surrounded by interesting equipment. And I think
1970-01-01 00:18:36: although that does cost money I'm sure you have friends or whatever who've got certain bits you
1970-01-01 00:18:42: could ask to borrow. I mean you can pick up four track cassette recorders for like 100 quid
1970-01-01 00:18:48: and it's great. It's a great way of actually having a bit of fun with it.
1970-01-01 00:18:54: So I'd say that really. That would be my advice.
