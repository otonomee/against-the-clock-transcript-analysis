1970-01-01 00:00:00: Oh hey, I didn't see you there.
1970-01-01 00:00:10: I'm Emejie Thakrai and this is My Against the Clock for fact.
1970-01-01 00:01:00: Now I'm going to do something like a regular phrase.
1970-01-01 00:09:00: I hate coming up with lyrics on the fly, but I think I've got something.
1970-01-01 00:09:51: No!
1970-01-01 00:09:52: Oh man, that's so much harder than you think it's going to be.
1970-01-01 00:10:19: Five minutes is nothing.
1970-01-01 00:10:22: What the fuck?
1970-01-01 00:10:32: So my musical upbringing was like playing trumpet and like a lot of different bands,
1970-01-01 00:10:36: like orchestras, soul bands, jazz bands, anything I could find up in Yorkshire where I grew
1970-01-01 00:10:41: up.
1970-01-01 00:10:42: But I also played the rhythm section instruments at home and it wasn't until I started studying
1970-01-01 00:10:48: jazz and then I studied jazz composition after that that I started doing more stuff at home
1970-01-01 00:10:53: on my own, started producing and making beats.
1970-01-01 00:10:55: I was really influenced by J. Dillam and a lot of house and through Falakuti started
1970-01-01 00:11:00: listening to loads of Afro beats.
1970-01-01 00:11:02: I think I've had to like really try and pinpoint the stuff that I make.
1970-01-01 00:11:07: It's like Afro house jazz beat or something maybe.
1970-01-01 00:11:15: Anything with a time pressure just makes me freak out.
1970-01-01 00:11:17: Stressful and challenging all the way through for that challenge.
1970-01-01 00:11:22: I didn't really plan what I was going to do before, which I probably should have done.
1970-01-01 00:11:26: All my stuff is all over the shop, so I was running back and forth.
1970-01-01 00:11:30: I had plans that I wanted to do some layered vocal harmonies and maybe some horns and some
1970-01-01 00:11:35: congas and stuff, but just didn't even get anywhere near the time to be able to do that.
1970-01-01 00:11:41: So yeah, it was stressful.
1970-01-01 00:11:42: Anything with a time limit makes me freak out.
