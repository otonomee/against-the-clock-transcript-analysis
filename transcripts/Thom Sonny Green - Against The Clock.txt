1970-01-01 00:00:00: Hi, I'm Tom with Sunny Green and I'm going to go against the clock for Fact TV.
1970-01-01 00:00:16: Right.
1970-01-01 00:01:16: Never had to rush like this in my life.
1970-01-01 00:02:16: Sorry, one more.
1970-01-01 00:04:16: How long has that been?
1970-01-01 00:04:43: Five thirty.
1970-01-01 00:04:46: Five thirty minutes gone.
1970-01-01 00:04:57: This goes really quickly.
1970-01-01 00:06:27: Oh shit.
1970-01-01 00:06:54: I'm sweating.
1970-01-01 00:07:54: I'm sweating.
1970-01-01 00:08:17: I'm sweating.
1970-01-01 00:08:36: I'm sweating.
1970-01-01 00:09:01: I'm sweating.
1970-01-01 00:09:13: Kick it.
1970-01-01 00:09:16: Fuck.
1970-01-01 00:09:22: Fuck.
1970-01-01 00:09:26: Fuck.
1970-01-01 00:09:49: This is way too hot.
1970-01-01 00:10:16: Fair enough.
1970-01-01 00:10:34: I think, yeah, it makes me realise how long it, how much time I actually spend.
1970-01-01 00:10:39: Because you can't like really experiment too much.
1970-01-01 00:10:42: Like usually, you know, you might take an hour working on just getting one particular sound on a drum.
1970-01-01 00:10:47: And like I was more aware of getting some kind of coherent sound together.
1970-01-01 00:10:54: It went so quickly.
1970-01-01 00:10:56: Yeah, I've not, I've not done that before.
1970-01-01 00:10:59: It's a good challenge actually.
1970-01-01 00:11:00: It's nice to have a little bit of time.
1970-01-01 00:11:02: There's so much more I could have done, obviously.
1970-01-01 00:11:06: Yeah, I mean, I usually take a while adding effects and things like that.
1970-01-01 00:11:10: So there's no time for that.
1970-01-01 00:11:12: You've got to, you know, if I was doing it again, I would have made sure that I'd have more, more coherent.
1970-01-01 00:11:17: Like three and a half minutes or something.
1970-01-01 00:11:20: But I'm curious to listen to it actually.
1970-01-01 00:11:23: It's my shite.
