1970-01-01 00:09:43: 10 seconds.
1970-01-01 00:10:13: So basically what I did here, I started with a sample from a track Fleetwood Mac, Dreams.
1970-01-01 00:10:22: And you can hear it.
1970-01-01 00:10:31: Just a little snippet and then repeat it with an arpeggiator.
1970-01-01 00:10:34: And then I just kept that going as a sort of like grooving drone sort of thing.
1970-01-01 00:10:44: And then layered on top of that the same thing again just to give it more sort of, just more texture, more depth.
1970-01-01 00:10:54: Another thing I do here is I'm using modulation, using an LFO linked to the sample offset,
1970-01-01 00:11:03: which means it's linked to the start point of the sample.
1970-01-01 00:11:08: So every time the sample's played, it's played in a slightly different position so it sounds different, sounds less sterile.
1970-01-01 00:11:24: And you get nice little effects like that.
1970-01-01 00:11:28: Then I laid some drums, a kick drum sampled from a TR-55.
1970-01-01 00:11:37: That's just for bottom end and then I laid a 707 kick on top of that to give it some top end weight.
1970-01-01 00:11:47: And then what else did I do with this bit here?
1970-01-01 00:11:51: Okay, sampled some hi-hats.
1970-01-01 00:11:57: And then I created a little sort of groove to go on top of it.
1970-01-01 00:12:11: So the MIDI sending it to the Moog over here.
1970-01-01 00:12:14: And I just kind of go over and play around with the filter envelope.
1970-01-01 00:12:20: And then play with some delay on top of that as well.
1970-01-01 00:12:23: And then I tried to get some chords in in time but I didn't quite get there with the Poly-6.
1970-01-01 00:12:29: And that's basically it. That was the ten minutes.
1970-01-01 00:12:50: Thanks for watching!
