1970-01-01 00:10:16: Thank you very much.
1970-01-01 00:10:35: So what I just did in this music making room which we call the district union is I did
1970-01-01 00:10:44: this little setup because I always like to change the different setups and I just worked
1970-01-01 00:10:49: with a couple of loopers and some gear like this drum pads and this drum synth and that
1970-01-01 00:10:56: keyboard trigger and that synthesizer and the memotron and this was fully unprepared
1970-01-01 00:11:03: and improvised in the sense that there is no pre-recorded loops or something.
1970-01-01 00:11:07: I was just creating them and like this recording those loops and improvising.
1970-01-01 00:11:13: This is one way for me to try things out to maybe get some ideas and every record that
1970-01-01 00:11:25: I work on I work in a different way sometimes it's more like on the computer sometimes even
1970-01-01 00:11:30: with phone apps sometimes with analog gear sometimes with other musicians and sometimes
1970-01-01 00:11:34: like now with loopers which is a lot of fun to quickly create an idea that maybe you can
1970-01-01 00:11:41: use or maybe not afterwards but this is what I tried this is three different loopers this is
1970-01-01 00:11:48: the electro harmonics this is a head rush pedal board and this is the Roland RC or boss RC 505
1970-01-01 00:11:56: this is a vermona drum machine analog drum synth and no drum pads the wonderful thermo
1970-01-01 00:12:06: chain with audio delay and well some other things here the memotron built in Berlin.
1970-01-01 00:12:11: I've used these kind of setups for smaller live performances that are in smaller spaces like
1970-01-01 00:12:20: cinema like a small cinema or galleries because in a club context it becomes very difficult with all
1970-01-01 00:12:25: these microphones looping could easily lead to feedback this is why I was working with headphones.
1970-01-01 00:12:31: I use loopers just but only one normally when I for instance do a DJ set now I'm preparing a
1970-01-01 00:12:40: live set in which I think I will work again differently I think I will work with one looper
1970-01-01 00:12:45: but I will also use some drum machines and stuff like that in this case I didn't want to use drum
1970-01-01 00:12:50: machine I wanted the rhythm to come out of the voice and out of the playing with my body.
