1970-01-01 00:00:00: Hey, it's Plastician and I'm about to go against the clock.
1970-01-01 00:00:12: Let's just get something basic in.
1970-01-01 00:00:42: That's out.
1970-01-01 00:01:12: gotta move that way.
1970-01-01 00:01:29: So nice.
1970-01-01 00:01:40: Okay, oops.
1970-01-01 00:01:52: Still getting used to what I'm doing with this guy right here.
1970-01-01 00:02:35: sounds like it's out of tune slightly to me, it's a different sample
1970-01-01 00:03:04: this is where it gets long trying to find something I know
1970-01-01 00:05:04: five minutes

1970-01-01 00:10:01: Ahhhhhhh.
1970-01-01 00:10:04: That's five.
1970-01-01 00:10:12: Run out.
1970-01-01 00:10:13: Run out of time.
1970-01-01 00:10:14: Normally takes me ages.
1970-01-01 00:10:15: That's it.
1970-01-01 00:10:16: Do you know what?
1970-01-01 00:10:30: I went up first, took this on, I thought I'm really quite slow in the production sense
1970-01-01 00:10:36: of things and I thought this would be like a challenge to me just to see what I can actually
1970-01-01 00:10:41: do in ten minutes because I would never think of someone who's particularly fast and ten
1970-01-01 00:10:47: minutes isn't a lot of time.
1970-01-01 00:10:49: Sometimes I can spend weeks and weeks just getting the tiniest part of a song finished
1970-01-01 00:10:54: so it would be interesting for me just to see what actually comes in ten minutes really.
