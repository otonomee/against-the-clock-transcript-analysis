1970-01-01 00:00:00: I'm a bit nervous because for me I'm not used to to do music like this like really
1970-01-01 00:00:10: like you know we have a time really short we love to take our time and just chill
1970-01-01 00:00:15: and try and try and try again and again so for me it's a bit something it's a
1970-01-01 00:00:19: challenge it's a challenge that's the idea but we're gonna try to make it in 10
1970-01-01 00:00:25: minutes yeah pretty excited and pretty stressed as well yeah four people in ten
1970-01-01 00:00:32: minutes it's a pretty big challenge hi guys I'm G, I'm Blancard, I'm Hugo and I'm
1970-01-01 00:00:37: Tromsky and we are La Fin Equipe and we go against the clock for fact
1970-01-01 00:00:55: yeah
1970-01-01 00:06:25: you tell me when it's good for you I stop and you stop
1970-01-01 00:10:59: yeah because I was like blocked you know what I mean like I was thinking too
1970-01-01 00:11:27: much on thing just I don't know why but it's take more time than usually so I
1970-01-01 00:11:32: was like at the end 10 minutes was so fast was crazy so I was fuck I just
1970-01-01 00:11:38: start to do things I was a bit like that I'm actually pretty yeah I'm cool
1970-01-01 00:11:44: because we showed that we work I mean we work like that when you're in the studio
1970-01-01 00:11:49: so it's but it takes 10 hours
1970-01-01 00:11:54: as we said we used to work like this but for a way longer time maybe try to be a
1970-01-01 00:12:00: little bit faster on everything but it's really an exercise that we are not used
1970-01-01 00:12:04: to we were basically layering stuff you know so in the end of the 10 minutes you
1970-01-01 00:12:10: have enough layers to make it sound like the beginning of the track but the for
1970-01-01 00:12:17: me the hardest part in this exercise is to create a kind of a song with movement
1970-01-01 00:12:23: and parts you know because everything was growing basically and you don't
1970-01-01 00:12:28: have that moment where you just have to break with the keys and stuff like that
1970-01-01 00:12:32: and also that's cool because we know each other for a long time and we didn't
1970-01-01 00:12:36: had to talk a lot because we are used to work together so I know what I need to
1970-01-01 00:12:43: do to layer my stuff on top of the beat for example first we met through
1970-01-01 00:12:48: turntablism and scratch music that was a long time ago we used to make music
1970-01-01 00:12:54: only with turntables and real records then we moved to beat making sound
1970-01-01 00:12:59: engineering and stuff we moved to Paris and now we've been touring for a few
1970-01-01 00:13:04: years now and we all changed the setup we all use Ableton Live we are all synced
1970-01-01 00:13:09: which helps a lot for the workflow and yeah so we share plugins and sample
1970-01-01 00:13:17: banks and stuff like that and so it really helps because we used to work
1970-01-01 00:13:20: with different samplers and beat machines and that was way harder I mean
1970-01-01 00:13:25: there is some stuff some more stuff in the live setup plus with this setup in
1970-01-01 00:13:31: live we can have the light like really synced with the live show which is really
1970-01-01 00:13:38: and in the studio because we were not in our studio and that's the difference I
1970-01-01 00:13:43: think with the other fact videos we've seen most of the guys were in their
1970-01-01 00:13:48: studio and so we couldn't bring all the keys all the synths and nothing was
1970-01-01 00:13:53: really plugged already at the beginning of the session so that was the choice
1970-01-01 00:13:58: was to take the the light version of basics how it works because we have a
1970-01-01 00:14:04: lot of stuff so we had the push Ableton Live we all have Ableton Live and we so
1970-01-01 00:14:11: we were using the link you know for the synchronization that's great I think
1970-01-01 00:14:15: when the links come out I think it changes the way we work it's really easy
1970-01-01 00:14:23: for us now to work all together the sync work really well so so basically we got
1970-01-01 00:14:29: push this turntable this one is the Pioneer DGM and which is cool because I'm
1970-01-01 00:14:37: the only one not really locked in so I can work around what they're making
1970-01-01 00:14:43: without being stuck by the synchronization and then you bring that
1970-01-01 00:14:48: one there's little OP-1 yeah OP-1 Kinobi that's my friend yeah I use it like
1970-01-01 00:14:53: really I really like it because it's really small and you can bring it
1970-01-01 00:14:58: everywhere and there's a lot of good sound in it so can do a lot of stuff with
1970-01-01 00:15:02: you can sample you can like there's some crazy sequencer inside yeah we are
1970-01-01 00:15:08: it's dangerous if you use the Wi-Fi but you can that's what we did one time we
1970-01-01 00:15:14: have a side project called Gang with two other guys and we were running six
1970-01-01 00:15:19: computers synced through the Wi-Fi and something went wrong so fortunately we
1970-01-01 00:15:27: managed to fix it during the live show so it was just for like half a track or
1970-01-01 00:15:31: something but now we go through real wires and we go for the hard way yes
1970-01-01 00:15:39: because it was so weird because some small synchronization problem but when
1970-01-01 00:15:44: you have six computer it's hard to know where it came from so it was terrible
1970-01-01 00:15:48: it was fun because the party was great with thousands of people so it was we
1970-01-01 00:15:54: did it at the end it was okay but for us was terrible like finding the problem
1970-01-01 00:16:00: yeah and the Ableton guy I have to say that the Ableton guy has told us not to do it
1970-01-01 00:16:05: yes Sylvain so we were warned yes it's true but we tried at least but it was really well with the with the cable
