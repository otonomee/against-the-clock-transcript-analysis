1970-01-01 00:00:00: Today I was just really wondering what to do with this. There's so many options so I decided to
1970-01-01 00:00:12: just go record chopping yesterday, pick the record and I'm gonna sample it and build something
1970-01-01 00:00:18: around that. Well it's summer time so I'm gonna go for a very very fresh summer vibe you know.
1970-01-01 00:00:23: Usually like the whole crux of a track it takes me about an hour to build you know and then the
1970-01-01 00:00:28: rest of it's refining but I usually work pretty fast. I'm Dance System and I'm going against the
1970-01-01 00:00:33: clock for fact.
1970-01-01 00:05:28: Again
1970-01-01 00:05:58: Getting
1970-01-01 00:06:20: any
1970-01-01 00:06:58: Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up.
1970-01-01 00:07:25: Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get
1970-01-01 00:07:55: up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up.
1970-01-01 00:08:25: I'm going out, I'm going out, I'm going out, I'm going out, I'm going out, I'm going out,
1970-01-01 00:08:32: I'm going out, I'm going out, I'm going out, I'm going out, I'm going out, I'm going out,
1970-01-01 00:08:39: I'm going out, I'm going out, I'm going out, I'm going out, I'm going out, I'm going out,
1970-01-01 00:08:44: I'm going out, I'm going out, I'm going out, I'm going out, I'm going out, I'm going out,
1970-01-01 00:08:49: I'm going out, I'm going out, I'm going out, I'm going out, I'm going out, I'm going out,
1970-01-01 00:08:56: I'm going out, I'm going out, I'm going out, I'm going out, I'm going out, I'm going out,
1970-01-01 00:09:03: I'm going out, I'm going out, I'm going out, I'm going out, I'm going out, I'm going out,
1970-01-01 00:09:10: I'm going out, I'm going out, I'm going out, I'm going out, I'm going out, I'm going out,
1970-01-01 00:09:17: I'm going out, I'm going out, I've gone yeah!
1970-01-01 00:09:47: Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out
1970-01-01 00:10:10: Get out, all night long
1970-01-01 00:10:17: Get out, all night long
1970-01-01 00:10:21: Get out all night long
1970-01-01 00:10:32: Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out
1970-01-01 00:10:47: There you go.
1970-01-01 00:10:58: That was probably one of the most stressful moments making music in my life.
1970-01-01 00:11:03: Normally it's like quite a meditative kind of experience for me.
1970-01-01 00:11:07: Like I don't think about like what I'm doing, but here it's just like,
1970-01-01 00:11:10: okay, I really need to like focus and just kind of make sure I'm doing everything right
1970-01-01 00:11:16: and on time, you know.
1970-01-01 00:11:17: I don't know if I'd change anything actually.
1970-01-01 00:11:19: I think I'm pretty happy with how it turned out.
1970-01-01 00:11:23: I mean the solid basis of a track is there.
1970-01-01 00:11:26: I'll just basically be going in and refining it at this point.
1970-01-01 00:11:29: Recently I've been doing a lot of sampling.
1970-01-01 00:11:32: I've been like digging for kind of mid 90s UK R&B and soul music.
1970-01-01 00:11:37: Like it's kind of everyone's like sampling disco stuff
1970-01-01 00:11:40: and I've been finding some rare shit that no one's even touching.
1970-01-01 00:11:45: My process is like buying the records and as soon as I hear it,
1970-01-01 00:11:48: I put it on the record deck and like just record it in and just find loops
1970-01-01 00:11:53: and then add drums after that.
1970-01-01 00:11:54: It's just like the simplest like kind of bare bones house music.
1970-01-01 00:11:58: Sometimes I go to this record shop in Seven Sisters called Zen Records
1970-01-01 00:12:03: and there's a guy there who's like just knows all of his shit.
1970-01-01 00:12:05: He was like a DJ back in those days and he just like pulls them out.
1970-01-01 00:12:09: It's like, yeah, you should know this one.
1970-01-01 00:12:11: The record I sampled today is by this group called The Cool Notes.
1970-01-01 00:12:15: They're actually from South London, he was telling me.
1970-01-01 00:12:18: And it's from like 1988 I think.
1970-01-01 00:12:22: But yeah, I like to get a little bit of knowledge about the records and the artists.
1970-01-01 00:12:26: You know, I mean, I just like to make the tracks and just play them out as soon as I...
1970-01-01 00:12:30: I don't worry about mastering and stuff.
1970-01-01 00:12:32: It's just like smash them out.
1970-01-01 00:12:34: That's the only way to test them, you know.
1970-01-01 00:12:35: Yeah, the process for building this was very, very simple.
1970-01-01 00:12:39: It was like production 101, just dropping in kick drums on the beat.
1970-01-01 00:12:47: And then recording in the claps from the MC 303.
1970-01-01 00:12:57: Just added a slight boost here on the claps to make it come through a bit more.
1970-01-01 00:13:04: Then I recorded the hi-hats.
1970-01-01 00:13:10: You notice I've got a flanger sound on there.
1970-01-01 00:13:15: This comes from the Ensoniq DP4, which has been my hero over the years.
1970-01-01 00:13:22: It's provided me with so much joy and so much good flange.
1970-01-01 00:13:26: Basically, the sample was just recorded in and you just find yourself a loop.
1970-01-01 00:13:34: So that's a loop without my effects.
1970-01-01 00:13:40: I've been using the Filter Freak quite a lot for filtering, which is really, like, really dope.
1970-01-01 00:13:47: Sound toys that make a lot of really sick plugins.
1970-01-01 00:13:57: I probably would have played with this a little bit more once I've got the track kind of fully set out.
1970-01-01 00:14:05: So in the breakdowns here, you can see my automation from this filter here.
1970-01-01 00:14:17: So you can just take that.
1970-01-01 00:14:26: And then just slamming it back in for the drop.
1970-01-01 00:14:29: It's kind of classic Thomas Bangalter, French house kind of vibes.
1970-01-01 00:14:35: And that's about it, really.
1970-01-01 00:14:37: Obviously, the turntable is a USB one, so it's really easy to just record the records in.
1970-01-01 00:14:45: It's an Audio Technica.
1970-01-01 00:14:47: Then for the hi-hats and clap, I just got this Roland Groove Box, which I always wanted one as a kid.
1970-01-01 00:14:54: I was on the back of DJ Mag looking at the ads for one of these and I finally got one.
1970-01-01 00:14:59: It's like 115 quid, but it's fun, you know.
1970-01-01 00:15:03: And then the 727, just like a classic percussion drum machine.
1970-01-01 00:15:09: I guess when I started producing probably like 2006, or maybe a bit before,
1970-01-01 00:15:19: I was a DJ first and then I started producing Fruity Loops 4 at the time and then just started kind of experimenting.
1970-01-01 00:15:26: I guess my first tracks that ever came out into the world were kind of like what I'm doing here.
1970-01-01 00:15:31: I was sampling stuff and making edits and adding new drums and stuff.
1970-01-01 00:15:35: And that was like in 2007, 2008.
1970-01-01 00:15:38: But recently, my other project Elvis 1990 has been running for a while,
1970-01-01 00:15:43: and Dance Systems is kind of a newer project just for me to smash out some dance bangers.
1970-01-01 00:15:52: I'm not musically trained either, so I think the best music I've made has always been from mistakes I've made.
1970-01-01 00:16:02: I think that's the best way to learn, is making mistakes and finding out what works and what's cool.
1970-01-01 00:16:07: My main advice would be to not look at what other people are doing, you know.
1970-01-01 00:16:11: And not to base your career or your music on what others are doing, because that shit will really fuck you up.
1970-01-01 00:16:21: It's easy enough to say, but I mean I find myself doing it.
1970-01-01 00:16:26: But if you can try and avoid doing that, that's the best.
