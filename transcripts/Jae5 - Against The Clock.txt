1970-01-01 00:10:09: Okay.
1970-01-01 00:10:11: Let's go.
1970-01-01 00:10:12: Alright.
1970-01-01 00:10:13: If an artist that's going to be really vocal and stuff, you don't want to be fighting them
1970-01-01 00:10:31: for space.
1970-01-01 00:10:32: But if the artist is not really going to be going down like that, then you have to kind
1970-01-01 00:10:37: So it depends on the artist.
1970-01-01 00:10:38: It's my go-to drum line when I'm stuck.
1970-01-01 00:10:45: It's just the easiest to do.
1970-01-01 00:10:46: Other elements that come together, probably the next part would be the bass.
1970-01-01 00:10:51: Four or five keys, simple, straightforward.
1970-01-01 00:10:57: The beat is just really a simple beat.
1970-01-01 00:10:59: The vibe is always different.
1970-01-01 00:11:00: Sometimes he's going to do a tune that's really simple like Did You See?
1970-01-01 00:11:02: And sometimes he wants to be grown up and do Common Sense, which is far, far left.
1970-01-01 00:11:06: So I can't actually say he's this way because it depends on his mood and the vibe he's in
1970-01-01 00:11:11: and what he's trying to achieve.
1970-01-01 00:11:12: So with Huss, it's versatile, so it's different for each tune.
