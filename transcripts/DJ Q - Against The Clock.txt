1970-01-01 00:07:12: song too I'm going to repeat this Champagne
1970-01-01 00:07:16: Two and a half, yeah.
1970-01-01 00:08:05: How long we got left?
1970-01-01 00:08:30: 140.
1970-01-01 00:09:00: Yeah.
1970-01-01 00:09:23: 30 seconds, yeah?
1970-01-01 00:09:46: No, 20.
1970-01-01 00:09:47: 20, yeah?
1970-01-01 00:09:48: Cool.
1970-01-01 00:09:49: Cool, I've got an intro on the drop then.
1970-01-01 00:10:19: You know what, I enjoyed that.
1970-01-01 00:10:35: It was a bit different to my normal workflow, but I made it work.
1970-01-01 00:10:38: I'm normally like a perfectionist, so when I'm making drums, for instance, I always go in and tweak every little thing as soon as I'm making them, rather than doing everything after.
1970-01-01 00:10:45: It takes me a bit longer than usual, but 10 minutes is a challenge and I think I did alright, I guess.
1970-01-01 00:10:50: It's similar, like getting ideas down, but in terms of finishing like a final track, I kind of take more time tweaking sounds, adding effects and compressing stuff, just making it sound better as I go along, rather than doing everything after.
1970-01-01 00:11:03: Do you know what, usually I start with drums.
1970-01-01 00:11:06: I get like a decent drum pattern and then work around that.
1970-01-01 00:11:08: But I thought, because I've got these synths, I'm going to try something different.
1970-01-01 00:11:11: The mix between software and hardware, really, I've got the Prophet Rev, the Juno 106, the Moog Sub Fighter there, and a few like rack of stuff there as well.
1970-01-01 00:11:19: This is like my little man cave in it, so I just try to bring everything here that I need to just enjoy and make music.
1970-01-01 00:11:25: Yeah, that's how I normally work it anyway, drums first and then build the intro around it, unless I've got an idea for a drop already in my head.
1970-01-01 00:11:31: So yeah, I work the intro and then get the drop right, man.
1970-01-01 00:11:34: I use Serum Massive.
1970-01-01 00:11:36: I think the Sub Fighter is decent for bass lines as well.
1970-01-01 00:11:39: If I'd have had more time, I'd have been able to get something decent out of that.
1970-01-01 00:11:41: I'll tell you what, one thing that's bugging me about this track, yeah, I'll show you now.
1970-01-01 00:11:45: See the vocals that I put in?
1970-01-01 00:11:49: You can kind of hear there's a lot of noise in the bottom end.
1970-01-01 00:11:54: What I usually do with vocals is, if I want to put EQ on it,
1970-01-01 00:12:03: and just kind of get rid of the unwanted frequencies there.
1970-01-01 00:12:10: So I cut it to about 100 Hz, and it kind of sounds a bit cleaner as well.
1970-01-01 00:12:17: So yeah, that's one thing, removing noise, that's one thing that I would suggest doing.
1970-01-01 00:12:23: Everyone just making music really.
1970-01-01 00:12:26: See, I spend most of my time doing that rather than like...
1970-01-01 00:12:29: So that's what takes me longer sometimes.
