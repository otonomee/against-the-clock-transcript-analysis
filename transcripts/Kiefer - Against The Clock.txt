1970-01-01 00:00:00: Yo, what's up?
1970-01-01 00:00:05: My name is Keefer and this is my Against the Clock with FACT.
1970-01-01 00:00:10: Cool.
1970-01-01 00:00:41: Just a little sketch.
1970-01-01 00:01:11: I'm gonna put a little shaker pattern on there.
1970-01-01 00:01:41: Speed this way the fuck up.
1970-01-01 00:02:03: See what that feels like.
1970-01-01 00:02:11: Let's try it there.
1970-01-01 00:03:11: Cool.
1970-01-01 00:03:41: That was reasonably good.
1970-01-01 00:04:10: It's fine for now.
1970-01-01 00:04:21: I'm gonna do that one knob filter.
1970-01-01 00:04:51: Cool.
1970-01-01 00:05:21: Cool.
1970-01-01 00:05:51: Cool.
1970-01-01 00:06:21: Cool.
1970-01-01 00:06:51: Cool.
1970-01-01 00:07:22: Good.
1970-01-01 00:07:23: Alright, thanks.
1970-01-01 00:07:51: I always end up slowing right back down here before I started.
1970-01-01 00:08:16: Cool.
1970-01-01 00:08:46: Cool.
1970-01-01 00:09:16: Oh, I could do one more thing.
1970-01-01 00:09:36: Cool.
1970-01-01 00:10:07: Cool.
1970-01-01 00:10:08: Thanks.
1970-01-01 00:10:09: Yeah, there was always piano in my house growing up.
1970-01-01 00:10:35: And my dad always played just like every day.
1970-01-01 00:10:40: He could hear him play.
1970-01-01 00:10:41: He plays like New Orleans style blues piano.
1970-01-01 00:10:42: I grew up listening to like Miles Davis, Oscar Pearson, John Coltrane, Sonny Clark, people
1970-01-01 00:10:47: like that.
1970-01-01 00:10:48: And then as I got into high school, I became very curious about how it was possible that
1970-01-01 00:10:55: people could improvise, you know, at such incredible speed over complex chord changes.
1970-01-01 00:11:04: And I just wanted to learn how to do that myself.
1970-01-01 00:11:08: You know, it's funny, what I did for this is similar to what I do at home.
1970-01-01 00:11:11: I mean, it was a little bit faster than normal.
1970-01-01 00:11:14: But I do like to get things done in a short amount of time.
1970-01-01 00:11:17: I base my entire process around trying to capture a feeling in the moment that it exists,
1970-01-01 00:11:23: which is not a lot of time.
1970-01-01 00:11:24: You know, from moment to moment, the emotional makeup of your life is changing and you want
1970-01-01 00:11:28: to capture that really quickly.
1970-01-01 00:11:30: I think about J. Dilla a lot, who made his beats really fast.
1970-01-01 00:11:32: I would have loved to see how well he would do in this because supposedly he made a lot
1970-01-01 00:11:37: of his greatest beats in 10, 15 minutes because he already knew how he was going to chop everything.
