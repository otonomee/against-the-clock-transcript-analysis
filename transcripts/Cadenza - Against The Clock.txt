1970-01-01 00:10:00: Cheers!
1970-01-01 00:10:30: I started out with like 14-15, the usual route, like 3-2 loops kind of thing and then just work that from there.
1970-01-01 00:10:42: I think it's useful, I think more people should try it because people often get lost in the details, you know.
1970-01-01 00:10:47: If there's a vibe happening you'll hear it quickly and I think 10 minutes is like a good marker for that.
1970-01-01 00:10:51: I'm used to doing ideas quickly because I want to like get the quickest something out of it quickly
1970-01-01 00:10:56: and then see if it's going to take anywhere but if it doesn't then just right away so yeah, did the best I could.
