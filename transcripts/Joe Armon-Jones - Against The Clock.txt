1970-01-01 00:00:00: We're up in Hiva Green, up in Quake Bass and Wulu's studio right now.
1970-01-01 00:00:11: Very pleased that they let us use it.
1970-01-01 00:00:13: Normally when I record songs, it's as long as the track is itself.
1970-01-01 00:00:19: So I go into the studio with the band and we just play.
1970-01-01 00:00:23: So if the track's five minutes, then the track takes five minutes to make.
1970-01-01 00:00:27: After that it's editing and it's mixing.
1970-01-01 00:00:29: You can spend years on that shit if you want.
1970-01-01 00:00:32: The making of the track and the writing of the music, I don't tend to spend ages and ages over.
1970-01-01 00:00:37: We haven't even really practiced in this set up to be honest.
1970-01-01 00:00:40: We did one session ages ago with Arm Quailu with Mars Wulu.
1970-01-01 00:00:44: But yeah man, this is just an idea.
1970-01-01 00:00:48: We'll see if it works.
1970-01-01 00:00:49: So behind the camera you can't see right now, but you will see we've got the incredible Quake Bass.
1970-01-01 00:00:54: Who's yeah, this whole studio is his brainchild.
1970-01-01 00:00:57: And yeah, all the midi stuff you're going to be hearing.
1970-01-01 00:01:01: When you're listening and watching and thinking, what's that?
1970-01-01 00:01:02: I can't see no one playing that.
1970-01-01 00:01:04: What's that? That's probably Quake.
1970-01-01 00:01:05: Some mad effects thing going on.
1970-01-01 00:01:07: So yeah, watch out Quake Bass.
1970-01-01 00:01:10: How you doing? My name's Joel Moon Jones.
1970-01-01 00:01:12: Me and Quake Bass are going to go against the clock for fact.
1970-01-01 00:01:24: Yeah.
1970-01-01 00:01:52: And one, two, three, four.
1970-01-01 00:02:27: And one, two, three, four.
1970-01-01 00:02:57: And one, two, three, four.
1970-01-01 00:03:27: And one, two, three, four.
1970-01-01 00:03:57: And one, two, three, four.
1970-01-01 00:04:03: And one, two, three, four.
1970-01-01 00:04:27: And one, two, three, four.
1970-01-01 00:04:57: I don't think it's, they're not looping together though,
1970-01-01 00:05:07: man, that's the thing.
1970-01-01 00:05:13: That's what I'm saying, you've got to play it to me.
1970-01-01 00:05:18: Okay, one, two.
1970-01-01 00:05:23: Okay, guys.
1970-01-01 00:05:37: Okay, one, two, three, four.
1970-01-01 00:05:48: Okay,
1970-01-01 00:05:53: one,
1970-01-01 00:05:58: two,
1970-01-01 00:06:03: three,
1970-01-01 00:06:08: four.
1970-01-01 00:06:13: Yeah.
1970-01-01 00:06:43: Okay.
1970-01-01 00:07:13: Okay.
1970-01-01 00:07:43: Okay.
1970-01-01 00:08:13: Okay.
1970-01-01 00:08:43: Okay.
1970-01-01 00:09:13: Okay.
1970-01-01 00:09:43: Okay.
1970-01-01 00:10:13: Okay.
1970-01-01 00:10:43: Okay.
1970-01-01 00:11:13: Yeah,
1970-01-01 00:11:18: I enjoyed it.
1970-01-01 00:11:23: I had fun, man.
1970-01-01 00:11:28: It was wicked, man.
1970-01-01 00:11:33: I enjoyed it.
1970-01-01 00:11:38: Yeah, man.
1970-01-01 00:11:43: Do a lot of work with Quake in my band context, in which case, like, Quake usually brings some of that stuff that you heard today, like a little bit of that rig, but then I have all the other instruments as well, so it's like a lot of stuff going on, so we wouldn't have quite as much MIDI stuff going on.
1970-01-01 00:11:50: But then me and Quake have a group with Miles Rulu called Armed Quailu, where that's, you know, I was bad.
1970-01-01 00:11:55: I was a little bit of a bad guy, but then I got to play with him.
1970-01-01 00:12:01: That's right.
1970-01-01 00:12:05: Those are the ESCs we were working together.
1970-01-01 00:12:09: Mor Bryant gave me special
1970-01-01 00:12:18: certainly the
1970-01-01 00:12:25: like deepening up what the Ultra Nova is doing.
1970-01-01 00:12:28: So Joe's just got like a lot of synth world at his fingers.
1970-01-01 00:12:31: And then in my rig is the same.
1970-01-01 00:12:33: If you see me in any context now,
1970-01-01 00:12:35: this, you know what I mean, the other ship,
1970-01-01 00:12:37: which is essentially the Looper 505,
1970-01-01 00:12:40: MPC Live, shout out Akai.
1970-01-01 00:12:43: And then a Yamaha like drum module essentially,
1970-01-01 00:12:47: for chopping up and doing weird things
1970-01-01 00:12:50: with the drums using triggers.
1970-01-01 00:12:52: And then within that,
1970-01-01 00:12:53: we just got a few send and return set up
1970-01-01 00:12:56: in the Ableton file to be able to
1970-01-01 00:12:59: kind of manipulate what Joe's doing in my end.
1970-01-01 00:13:02: And then from there, just try and have a jam
1970-01-01 00:13:05: and build something on the fly.
1970-01-01 00:13:06: Do you know what I mean?
1970-01-01 00:13:07: But this thing's been building for a long time.
1970-01-01 00:13:09: Yeah, 100%.
1970-01-01 00:13:11: 100%.
1970-01-01 00:13:11: Through doing the trio particularly,
1970-01-01 00:13:13: we've, you know what I mean,
1970-01-01 00:13:15: we've been able to understand, you know,
1970-01-01 00:13:18: the improvisation side as well as the composition side
1970-01-01 00:13:21: through Joe's stuff.
1970-01-01 00:13:22: Just getting into that really
1970-01-01 00:13:24: and just being able to indulge, I suppose,
1970-01-01 00:13:26: you know, cause there's a lot behind the notes.
1970-01-01 00:13:29: Do you know what I mean?
1970-01-01 00:13:30: So for us it's quite fun to indulge in a jam
1970-01-01 00:13:34: and have a constraint, I suppose.
1970-01-01 00:13:35: You know what I mean?
1970-01-01 00:13:36: And man like, yeah, step in.
1970-01-01 00:13:38: What'd you mean?
1970-01-01 00:13:39: Come here.
1970-01-01 00:13:40: Step in, blood.
1970-01-01 00:13:41: You get me?
1970-01-01 00:13:43: Yeah, yeah.
1970-01-01 00:13:44: We're just chatting about Arm Quailer, innit?
1970-01-01 00:13:45: All right, all right.
1970-01-01 00:13:46: You know what I mean?
1970-01-01 00:13:47: Yeah.
1970-01-01 00:13:48: Tell them what, just in case you don't know,
1970-01-01 00:13:50: that shit.
1970-01-01 00:13:51: This guy.
1970-01-01 00:13:52: Arm Quailer.
1970-01-01 00:13:53: Get like an Ardouar snapshot for that bit.
1970-01-01 00:13:55: I just need batteries.
1970-01-01 00:13:56: That's what I mean.
1970-01-01 00:13:57: I just need some batteries, guys.
1970-01-01 00:14:01: One little thing for me would be the mapping
1970-01-01 00:14:06: of the midi notes.
1970-01-01 00:14:08: This is quite an intricate, well, not intricate,
1970-01-01 00:14:09: but just the type of shit I like doing.
1970-01-01 00:14:12: You know what I mean?
1970-01-01 00:14:13: To be able to remap the samples.
1970-01-01 00:14:15: So instead of me using them as firing off,
1970-01-01 00:14:17: I can then fire them with the drums.
1970-01-01 00:14:20: Apart from that,
1970-01-01 00:14:22: I was kind of dope, man, seeing you play the drums and then...
1970-01-01 00:14:25: Yeah, that's what I mean.
1970-01-01 00:14:26: Like, there's, yeah.
1970-01-01 00:14:28: You've got that technique down.
1970-01-01 00:14:29: That's my shit, you know.
1970-01-01 00:14:30: I like to be, that's why the hi-hats on the other side
1970-01-01 00:14:32: and all that, to be able to have one side for electric,
1970-01-01 00:14:35: one side for acoustic.
1970-01-01 00:14:36: I mean, the most powerful piece of advice to people,
1970-01-01 00:14:39: I don't know, people hear this a lot,
1970-01-01 00:14:42: and say it a lot,
1970-01-01 00:14:43: but it doesn't seem to strike home a lot for some reason.
1970-01-01 00:14:46: It's just like, you have to sound like yourself,
1970-01-01 00:14:49: whether that's making a spaceship around your drum kit,
1970-01-01 00:14:53: like Giles has,
1970-01-01 00:14:54: so that you don't sound like any other drummer,
1970-01-01 00:14:57: even without the spaceship.
1970-01-01 00:14:58: Like, Giles has his own style, his own way of playing,
1970-01-01 00:15:01: but it's about formulating something that is unique to you,
1970-01-01 00:15:06: no one else has, basically.
1970-01-01 00:15:07: Which is, it sounds cheesy,
1970-01-01 00:15:08: because people hear it a lot,
1970-01-01 00:15:09: but it's genuine.
1970-01-01 00:15:10: A lot of people's starting point with producing is like,
1970-01-01 00:15:13: all right, I'm gonna make beats that sound like that guy,
1970-01-01 00:15:15: and then we'll make beats that sound like that guy.
1970-01-01 00:15:17: It's a good process,
1970-01-01 00:15:18: like jazz musicians transcribe Charlie Barker,
1970-01-01 00:15:21: and they transcribe whoever, you know,
1970-01-01 00:15:23: but there needs to be a point where you're like,
1970-01-01 00:15:25: okay, I'm gonna make a beat that sounds completely
1970-01-01 00:15:27: not like these people, you know.
1970-01-01 00:15:28: Same with composing and everything,
1970-01-01 00:15:30: it's all the same thing.
1970-01-01 00:15:32: I'd further that point just to say, like, you know,
1970-01-01 00:15:36: if it's really like what you're into,
1970-01-01 00:15:38: you should definitely explore hardware,
1970-01-01 00:15:41: just as a point, as another thing to do,
1970-01-01 00:15:44: because I think the limitation then starts to stem
1970-01-01 00:15:48: your personality, so to speak,
1970-01-01 00:15:49: of how you use these boxes and all of this,
1970-01-01 00:15:52: you know what I mean?
1970-01-01 00:15:52: Not to say don't use computers,
1970-01-01 00:15:54: obviously a lot of men do a lot of things in the box,
1970-01-01 00:15:57: you know what I mean, it's deep.
1970-01-01 00:15:58: For me personally, as Joe says, you know,
1970-01-01 00:16:00: everyone develop their style,
1970-01-01 00:16:01: and I think what I learned from using hardware
1970-01-01 00:16:04: then affects how I see and approach the drums, for example.
1970-01-01 00:16:08: So I would definitely say get a box and just fucking shed it.
1970-01-01 00:16:12: Same goes for assembly,
1970-01-01 00:16:14: any instrumentalists who don't even mess with box here,
1970-01-01 00:16:18: like that's an important thing to start getting into
1970-01-01 00:16:22: and learning how to use production stuff
1970-01-01 00:16:25: if you're a musician, because it's like knowing
1970-01-01 00:16:27: about harmony or something, or rhythm,
1970-01-01 00:16:29: like knowing about those aspects,
1970-01-01 00:16:31: because you're just gonna be coming up against them
1970-01-01 00:16:32: all the time, so you might as well understand them, you know.
1970-01-01 00:16:35: Shout out RaggoFoo, shout out the room,
1970-01-01 00:16:38: them ones, Don London.
1970-01-01 00:16:39: Shout out to the room studios, man.
1970-01-01 00:16:40: Same, you know, Wokwon, my brother Wooloo,
1970-01-01 00:16:43: and Kwae Lu, you know what I'm saying.
1970-01-01 00:16:45: Question mark, exclamation mark.
1970-01-01 00:16:47: You got me.
