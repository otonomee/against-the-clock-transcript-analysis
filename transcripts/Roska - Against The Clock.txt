1970-01-01 00:00:00: This is Ross Gar going against the clock for Fact TV.
1970-01-01 00:00:15: Let's go.
1970-01-01 00:00:16: Alright, one more time.
1970-01-01 00:00:17: Stick to a drum pad we've got already, why not?
1970-01-01 00:00:48: Alright, I'm just programming my drums in.
1970-01-01 00:01:06: I find it so much easier to just program the drums.
1970-01-01 00:01:09: Let's program what I want in there.
1970-01-01 00:02:09: Give it a little swing.
1970-01-01 00:02:32: Swing.
1970-01-01 00:02:33: If you hear a random noise in the background, it's probably a squirrel on the top of my
1970-01-01 00:03:00: studio.
1970-01-01 00:03:01: They seem to run across and run across the trees.
1970-01-01 00:03:05: A couple of sirens in the background.
1970-01-01 00:03:11: We've got three minutes, right?
1970-01-01 00:03:58: Let's give ourselves an extra.
1970-01-01 00:04:23: Four minutes, yeah?
1970-01-01 00:04:44: Alright, let's go.
1970-01-01 00:05:14: Cool.
1970-01-01 00:05:15: Enough time to just arrange this shit.
1970-01-01 00:06:08: How much minutes?
1970-01-01 00:06:27: It's on six now, yeah?
1970-01-01 00:06:57: Alright, let's go.
1970-01-01 00:07:46: Where is it?
1970-01-01 00:08:05: Where is it?
1970-01-01 00:08:21: Eight minutes, yeah?
1970-01-01 00:08:42: Cool.
1970-01-01 00:08:44: Using a couple of loops, I feel like I've cheated, but it's all good.
1970-01-01 00:08:51: I think I'm going to leave my tuners there, but what else can I add in there?
1970-01-01 00:09:12: A minute, yeah?
1970-01-01 00:09:17: Cool.
1970-01-01 00:09:18: Yeah.
1970-01-01 00:09:55: What were we on?
1970-01-01 00:10:05: Ten seconds.
1970-01-01 00:10:06: Ten seconds, yeah, cool.
1970-01-01 00:10:07: I'm just going through some more bits that I've got here.
1970-01-01 00:10:29: I've got Adam A7Xs that I use day to day, and then I've got my machine, which I use
1970-01-01 00:10:36: now and then.
1970-01-01 00:10:37: I've got Korg as well, Micro Korg.
1970-01-01 00:10:39: I use Logic to do all my production, and I used to use Fruity Loops.
1970-01-01 00:10:43: I've got my PC down there.
1970-01-01 00:10:45: Most of the stuff I use through there, I've got quite a few of my own drums I use.
1970-01-01 00:10:50: Sometimes I use FRAKTY drums and just mess about with the actual sounds and stuff, but
1970-01-01 00:10:54: yeah, that's pretty much it.
1970-01-01 00:10:55: The way I work with my drums, I use the machine a lot for percussion and stuff, and I know
1970-01-01 00:11:01: exactly where I want the kick and the snare majority of the time, so I just usually just
1970-01-01 00:11:05: get the right kick, the right snare that I want, and then I just program it straight
1970-01-01 00:11:08: in.
1970-01-01 00:11:09: Same with percussion, I usually chop up looped hi-hats and stuff, and use my own hi-hats
1970-01-01 00:11:16: in there just to fill it out as well.
1970-01-01 00:11:18: When I've done I Need Love, it's the same sort of chords as well.
1970-01-01 00:11:23: So yeah, just same sort of vibe signature sort of sound of where I come from and what
1970-01-01 00:11:30: I've been doing over the last few years.
