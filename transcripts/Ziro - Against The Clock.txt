1970-01-01 00:00:00: This is
1970-01-01 00:00:14: Zero Against the Clock, Fact TV.
1970-01-01 00:00:18: Normally start with two, three kick drums, a bit of tonal variation, and make some sort of a beat, 4-4 or a break beat.
1970-01-01 00:00:38: So, get a couple of them in there, layer them in various different ways, but make sure they don't phase out.
1970-01-01 00:00:50: Do something a bit too steppy, or break beat.
1970-01-01 00:00:57: That'll do.
1970-01-01 00:01:02: Actually take it up to a decent tempo, 130.
1970-01-01 00:01:11: Occasional little variation.
1970-01-01 00:01:41: That's cool.
1970-01-01 00:01:51: Loop.
1970-01-01 00:02:02: Normally try and get some sort of percussive stuff, again, to layer with the kicks.
1970-01-01 00:02:11: So, I've got various dungeon-y noises.
1970-01-01 00:02:36: Okay, I can start layering, well, just really creating some sort of ambience for the drums, whether it's by layering other stuff over it, or a few noises in the background.
1970-01-01 00:02:46: I've got something that's quite reverb-y, and generally nice.
1970-01-01 00:02:57: Find a part with some character in it.
1970-01-01 00:03:04: That'll do.
1970-01-01 00:03:14: That up.
1970-01-01 00:03:35: I want the kicks to kind of knock through that a little bit, so we'll side chain.
1970-01-01 00:04:03: I'm going to add a bassline there, so I'm going to take the sub out of the ambience, if you will, so it doesn't end up causing problems.
1970-01-01 00:04:14: Right, I was banging on.
1970-01-01 00:04:43: Okay.
1970-01-01 00:04:51: Right, let's see some stuff I've built myself.
1970-01-01 00:05:01: Okay, I've got a loop there, which is a few hi-hats and some sort of wooden clicky noises, which I've done with just a whole load of effects, basically, and then bounced it out.
1970-01-01 00:05:20: So it sounds like that.
1970-01-01 00:05:26: I'm just going to give it a bit more groove again.
1970-01-01 00:05:48: Right.
1970-01-01 00:06:03: Right, I've got another kick, which is of layers with a sub in G, about 50 hertz.
1970-01-01 00:06:12: So I'm going to bang that in.
1970-01-01 00:06:19: I do sometimes use 808s, other things like that, clean subs, but this kind of works quite well with breakbeat techno, which this is.
1970-01-01 00:06:37: Take some of the mid out of the ambience so that it clears down a bit.
1970-01-01 00:06:46: I've got a fairly decent canvas to stick some stuff on.
1970-01-01 00:06:52: What else have I got?
1970-01-01 00:07:00: Some bobs from other trucks.
1970-01-01 00:07:11: That sounds quite cool.
1970-01-01 00:07:18: Right, okay.
1970-01-01 00:07:23: So again, looping up various dark noises, reverbs and things like that.
1970-01-01 00:07:37: Yep.
1970-01-01 00:07:42: Some sort of something to make a snare. I'm not a big fan of snares, but there is something in that frequency range that is necessary.
1970-01-01 00:07:53: So, that'll do.
1970-01-01 00:08:01: We'll crack that in on the fours.
1970-01-01 00:08:18: Maybe another one somewhere in the middle.
1970-01-01 00:08:27: That'll do.
1970-01-01 00:08:30: Not too many little clicks on that.
1970-01-01 00:08:42: That's nice as well.
1970-01-01 00:08:54: Right, so I've got a reasonably basic bit.
1970-01-01 00:09:11: Okay.
1970-01-01 00:09:18: And then, let's put some stuff in from this thing.
1970-01-01 00:09:22: I've got a patch loaded on here.
1970-01-01 00:09:28: Maybe try a bit more acidic.
1970-01-01 00:09:38: Let's turn it up a bit.
1970-01-01 00:09:53: That sounds very quiet.
1970-01-01 00:10:18: Okay.
1970-01-01 00:10:40: Okay.
