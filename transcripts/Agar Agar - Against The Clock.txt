1970-01-01 00:00:00: Basically for us this song is like this really...
1970-01-01 00:00:08: It's always about jamming.
1970-01-01 00:00:09: Yeah, it's a jamming song.
1970-01-01 00:00:10: It's like the song we have that we play in life that is never the same, never sounding
1970-01-01 00:00:14: the same.
1970-01-01 00:00:15: It's just, yeah.
1970-01-01 00:00:16: It's always like we let ourselves...
1970-01-01 00:00:17: We don't want it to have a structure.
1970-01-01 00:00:18: ... playing longer or shorter and it's, yeah, there's no like closed format.
1970-01-01 00:00:23: I mainly modulate synthesizers and these modulations are very like different from one time to another
1970-01-01 00:00:29: because I don't know, it's all about like what your fingers do, it's like drawing and
1970-01-01 00:00:33: stuff like that.
1970-01-01 00:00:34: You can not draw the same line twice.
1970-01-01 00:00:37: Hey, it's Agar Agar and it's our Against the Clock.
1970-01-01 00:02:29: It's cold and it's dead up to take a nap.
1970-01-01 00:02:54: It gives me shivers, shivers, shivers, shivers, shivers, shivers, shivers.
1970-01-01 00:03:25: Okay, I understood that their existence was less empty than mine since they had a cover
1970-01-01 00:03:31: to entertain me.
1970-01-01 00:03:32: Oh, yes!
1970-01-01 00:03:36: The stool had just appeared in the cover of the group.
1970-01-01 00:03:39: I wanted to sit there because I was sitting on stools, yeah.
1970-01-01 00:03:44: Because it gives me shivers.
1970-01-01 00:03:56: It gives me shivers.
1970-01-01 00:04:13: Wow!

1970-01-01 00:05:30: It's cold and it's dead and I don't care.

1970-01-01 00:08:38: this
1970-01-01 00:08:40: It's falling down
1970-01-01 00:08:44: It's falling down
1970-01-01 00:08:49: It's falling down
1970-01-01 00:08:54: It's falling down
1970-01-01 00:08:59: It's falling down
1970-01-01 00:09:04: It's falling down
1970-01-01 00:09:10: It's falling down
1970-01-01 00:09:15: It's falling down
1970-01-01 00:09:20: It's falling down
1970-01-01 00:09:24: It's falling down
1970-01-01 00:09:30: And here
1970-01-01 00:09:32: Going to take another turn
1970-01-01 00:11:05: We met in art school like four years ago and we decided to do this project maybe like three
1970-01-01 00:11:18: years ago now.
1970-01-01 00:11:19: It wasn't a project at all.
1970-01-01 00:11:20: No, it wasn't supposed to be a project.
1970-01-01 00:11:22: It was just like about playing music and trying new stuff and experiment and see where it
1970-01-01 00:11:28: goes.
1970-01-01 00:11:29: And now we're here.
1970-01-01 00:11:32: We both had our parents kind of like forcing us to do the conservatory.
1970-01-01 00:11:38: I don't know if you said...
1970-01-01 00:11:39: They didn't force me.
1970-01-01 00:11:40: They did.
1970-01-01 00:11:41: For my part.
1970-01-01 00:11:43: But yeah, we had this like classical evolution of the typical.
1970-01-01 00:11:50: And then I guess we...
1970-01-01 00:11:51: We kept making music with our way.
1970-01-01 00:11:58: For me, the voice is like an instrument, part of the process.
1970-01-01 00:12:02: So that's usually when I improvise, it's just of course yogurt.
1970-01-01 00:12:07: And then from the melody I take, then I write lyrics.
1970-01-01 00:12:11: I never do the other way around.
1970-01-01 00:12:15: Then I decide what I want to talk about with him.
1970-01-01 00:12:18: I'm like, hey, what do you want to...
1970-01-01 00:12:20: Usually, if it's a specific atmosphere, I have an idea of what I want.
1970-01-01 00:12:27: I don't want to talk about a love song or something...
1970-01-01 00:12:32: I wouldn't say shallow, but really typical.
1970-01-01 00:12:35: I like to describe things I see.
1970-01-01 00:12:41: Just like a really simple description of something I see is, I think for me, maybe even more
1970-01-01 00:12:47: poetic than a love song.
1970-01-01 00:12:49: It's just like, oh, there's that girl in the bubble in the middle of the sea with a parrot.
1970-01-01 00:12:56: It's like, oh, so that's my story right there.
1970-01-01 00:12:59: There's nothing else.
1970-01-01 00:13:00: It's just like...
