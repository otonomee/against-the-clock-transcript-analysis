1970-01-01 00:00:00: Hi, I'm Dave Boyetbit and I'm about to go against the clock for Fact TV.
1970-01-01 00:00:31: This is the Moon Pig sample of me on the Pampites, which I said I'd try and use.
1970-01-01 00:00:48: Obviously I'm going to try and change it a bit, so let's add a little kind of filter to it.
1970-01-01 00:01:00: I'll make it a little rougher.
1970-01-01 00:01:11: Come on now.
1970-01-01 00:01:30: Cool, I think I'm going to add delay and reverb.
1970-01-01 00:01:43: Sends, just to make it easier and make this a bit more interesting.
1970-01-01 00:02:02: Let's do some drums.
1970-01-01 00:03:12: I also said I'd use someone's recording of their daughter singing that Moon Pig thing.
1970-01-01 00:03:23: Long words are good because you can make notes out of them.
1970-01-01 00:03:32: Let's use that loop it really simply.
1970-01-01 00:03:36: Maybe some kind of arpeggiated thing.
1970-01-01 00:04:06: Right, I want to get some 3A3 in here.
1970-01-01 00:04:09: Actually where's that cut? Oh, it's in here. Maybe I'll do some hats off this actually.
1970-01-01 00:04:15: What's this in? B.
1970-01-01 00:04:18: And with that cable out of there.
1970-01-01 00:04:21: And two beds, one stone.
1970-01-01 00:04:24: How much time have I got?
1970-01-01 00:04:26: I've got about a minute.
1970-01-01 00:04:29: I've got about a minute.
1970-01-01 00:04:32: I've got about a minute.
1970-01-01 00:04:35: I've got about a minute.
1970-01-01 00:04:38: I've got about a minute.
1970-01-01 00:04:41: I've got about a minute.
1970-01-01 00:04:44: Two beds, one stone.
1970-01-01 00:04:47: How much time have I got?
1970-01-01 00:05:00: Right, so let's get these hats in here.
1970-01-01 00:05:09: Let's go for the 505. I quite like it.
1970-01-01 00:05:27: This is the close hat.
1970-01-01 00:05:39: I would like to make some kind of funky meets 3A3 hybrid.
1970-01-01 00:05:54: Let's put this into the slicer and see if we can make anything.
1970-01-01 00:06:03: Where's the high note in here?
1970-01-01 00:06:09: Is it just all?
1970-01-01 00:06:15: My 3A3 isn't synced, that's why I'm not syncing it to the...
1970-01-01 00:06:21: Let's add a string.
1970-01-01 00:06:24: String machine.
1970-01-01 00:06:30: These screws...
1970-01-01 00:06:33: I don't know what key I'm using.
1970-01-01 00:06:36: I'm just going to put them in.
1970-01-01 00:06:39: I'm just going to put them in.
1970-01-01 00:06:42: I'm just going to put them in.
1970-01-01 00:06:45: I'm just going to put them in.
1970-01-01 00:06:48: I don't know what the tuning is on this at all.
1970-01-01 00:06:58: We won't bother with that.
1970-01-01 00:07:05: I want to use that. That's quite nice.
1970-01-01 00:07:08: Fleetwood.
1970-01-01 00:07:11: I've just changed the tuning of that overnight.
1970-01-01 00:08:12: Samples.
1970-01-01 00:08:15: That's all in one pattern, which is interesting.
1970-01-01 00:08:42: You can start splitting it down.
1970-01-01 00:08:46: Let's see if we can find any other samples quickly.
1970-01-01 00:08:50: I'm not going to have time.
1970-01-01 00:08:53: I wanted to make a zappy noise maybe.
1970-01-01 00:08:57: Where is it?
1970-01-01 00:09:00: This might not be usable in any way.
1970-01-01 00:09:03: This might not be usable in any way.
1970-01-01 00:09:06: I...
1970-01-01 00:09:09: Hmm.
1970-01-01 00:09:20: I'm not sure how to do this.
1970-01-01 00:09:23: I'm not sure how to do this.
1970-01-01 00:09:27: Oh, boy.
1970-01-01 00:09:41: So...
1970-01-01 00:09:44: I'm not going to have time to do any kind of arrangement on this.
1970-01-01 00:09:47: I'm not going to have time to do any kind of arrangement on this.
1970-01-01 00:09:50: How long have I got?
1970-01-01 00:09:53: Ten seconds.
1970-01-01 00:09:56: It's not really worth doing anymore.
1970-01-01 00:09:59: It's not really worth doing anymore.
1970-01-01 00:10:02: I could have added a string.
1970-01-01 00:10:05: I could have added a string.
1970-01-01 00:10:15: That's my time up.
1970-01-01 00:10:28: I read the bit about being able to prepare your samples,
1970-01-01 00:10:31: so I kind of had a little dig about in mine and my partner's record collection.
1970-01-01 00:10:34: I found some of these Music for Home movies records,
1970-01-01 00:10:37: and they had some quite good military sounds that I thought were quite percussive.
1970-01-01 00:10:41: So on this one, one of them is the mortar hit,
1970-01-01 00:10:44: and the other one is like a gun.
1970-01-01 00:10:47: I also took a sample of this album, which came out last year,
1970-01-01 00:10:50: the drums, which I wanted to chop, and used the samples from that.
1970-01-01 00:10:53: I also took a sample of this album, which came out last year, the drums, which I wanted to chop, and used the samples from that.
1970-01-01 00:10:56: That's what I was doing. I was dragging out the hi-hat and the kick.
1970-01-01 00:10:59: I only did one bar, which is annoying,
1970-01-01 00:11:02: but I wanted to kind of build up the layers, so I really wanted to add.
1970-01-01 00:11:05: I'm a big fan of the 505 hats.
1970-01-01 00:11:08: As you can see, I like things with batteries, because you don't have cables, there's not many cables.
1970-01-01 00:11:11: I really wanted to get those hats in.
1970-01-01 00:11:14: The 303, I wanted to get in, so I just recorded something off that.
1970-01-01 00:11:17: I would have liked to have programmed it,
1970-01-01 00:11:20: but it's pretty temperamental, and the time goes pretty quickly.
1970-01-01 00:11:23: but it's pretty temperamental, and the time goes pretty quickly.
1970-01-01 00:11:26: So probably, yeah, these are just getting ideas together.
1970-01-01 00:11:29: So obviously there was the initial Moon Pig riff,
1970-01-01 00:11:32: which I kind of added filters and chopped,
1970-01-01 00:11:35: and then the guy, I think he's called Dan's daughter.
1970-01-01 00:11:38: I wanted to, what I do a lot is take voices and then cut off the initial attack
1970-01-01 00:11:41: I wanted to, what I do a lot is take voices and then cut off the initial attack
1970-01-01 00:11:44: and use the rest as a chord.
1970-01-01 00:11:47: As you can tell, I like samples. I use liking samples and chopping them up.
1970-01-01 00:11:50: As you can tell, I like samples. I use liking samples and chopping them up.
1970-01-01 00:11:53: So yeah, only one bar, sadly,
1970-01-01 00:11:56: but obviously then the next thing would be to duplicate and add fills.
1970-01-01 00:11:59: Effects-wise, I kind of like this Korg Monotron.
1970-01-01 00:12:02: Again battery powered, plugged into this old Zoom,
1970-01-01 00:12:05: This old Zoom,
1970-01-01 00:12:08: guitar effects pedal, which is pretty low-fi,
1970-01-01 00:12:11: but you can get some good, there's some good delay on there somewhere.
1970-01-01 00:12:14: but you can get some good, there's some good delay on there somewhere.
1970-01-01 00:12:17: Or just weird noises. So I quite often use that for effects.
1970-01-01 00:12:20: Or just weird noises. So I quite often use that for effects.
1970-01-01 00:12:23: And that's it, really, I use Brutal looks on an, or FL Studio on a PC.
1970-01-01 00:12:26: And that's it, really, I use Brutal looks on an, or FL Studio on a PC.
1970-01-01 00:12:29: Yeah. Another thing I did was I kind of lost my microphone so I recorded these
1970-01-01 00:12:35: pan pipes that I said someone I'd used doing the moon pig jingle onto my phone
1970-01-01 00:12:40: and emailed it and that's what I had initially.
1970-01-01 00:12:43: Just, I don't know, screw it.
1970-01-01 00:12:46: Yeah, I just had that and recorded that in and then thought I'd use that.
1970-01-01 00:12:49: So, very high tech. I bought a mic from the charity, not the charity shop,
1970-01-01 00:12:53: from the pound shop but it was rubbish so I didn't use it.
1970-01-01 00:12:55: So yeah, iPhone recording, hi-fi.
1970-01-01 00:12:59: Yeah.
