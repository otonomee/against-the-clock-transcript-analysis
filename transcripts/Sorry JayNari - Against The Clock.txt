1970-01-01 00:11:27: I mean, I got the synths out the way.
1970-01-01 00:11:29: I got the flute out the way. I got the vocal sample.
1970-01-01 00:11:31: I already had the vocal sample made, so...
1970-01-01 00:11:33: I don't know. I kind of cheated
1970-01-01 00:11:35: with that one, but then I got the 808.
1970-01-01 00:11:37: You know, like, I got pretty much the whole
1970-01-01 00:11:39: beat, man. Like, you could...

1970-01-01 00:12:05: So hot, I'm hot as a fire.
1970-01-01 00:12:07: Oh, shit, you know what I forgot?
1970-01-01 00:12:09: Oh, you got the tags, nigga.
1970-01-01 00:12:11: Sorry, J-Narry.
1970-01-01 00:12:13: Oh, this a special damn.
1970-01-01 00:12:15: Sorry, J-Narry.
1970-01-01 00:12:17: Sorry, J-Narry.
1970-01-01 00:12:19: One more time for the face, bro.
1970-01-01 00:12:21: Sorry, J-Narry.
1970-01-01 00:12:25: Sorry, J-Narry.
1970-01-01 00:12:27: They don't teach that.
1970-01-01 00:12:29: Oh, we got to get them.
1970-01-01 00:12:31: I probably put, you know,
1970-01-01 00:12:33: some more vocal chops in it.
1970-01-01 00:12:35: I put another sound
1970-01-01 00:12:37: in there for sure because that's what I
1970-01-01 00:12:39: really wanted to do was really like
1970-01-01 00:12:41: stack my melodies, maybe put
1970-01-01 00:12:43: like two or three more, you know,
1970-01-01 00:12:45: synths in there, maybe a bass line,
1970-01-01 00:12:47: pretty much like, you know, get an 808
1970-01-01 00:12:49: rest. Just make it more
1970-01-01 00:12:51: complex, maybe put some gross beat effects
1970-01-01 00:12:53: on it. Tied out the Fruity
1970-01-01 00:12:55: Loops, man, for that gross beat. Gross Beat is
1970-01-01 00:12:57: one of the fucking, the best plugins
1970-01-01 00:12:59: ever, man. And if you a real
1970-01-01 00:13:01: Fruity Loops head, you know about that
1970-01-01 00:13:03: gross beat.
1970-01-01 00:13:05: I use FL-10 because
1970-01-01 00:13:07: I'm real big on the legacy blocks.
1970-01-01 00:13:09: Just to sound like dynamically,
1970-01-01 00:13:11: like you get bigger drums and shit
1970-01-01 00:13:13: like on FL-10.
1970-01-01 00:13:15: Well, in, you know, my experience.
1970-01-01 00:13:17: You got the Akai MPK
1970-01-01 00:13:19: Mini, it's small, and it
1970-01-01 00:13:21: got a pitch stick instead of a wheel,
1970-01-01 00:13:23: so that's why I like that one. But
1970-01-01 00:13:25: I just did a project
1970-01-01 00:13:27: with AD, last
1970-01-01 00:13:29: set of 80s, and that shit's going crazy.
1970-01-01 00:13:31: We got, you know,
1970-01-01 00:13:33: Tory Lanez on there, we got
1970-01-01 00:13:35: Wiz Khalifa on there, we got all kind of crazy
1970-01-01 00:13:37: people on there. And man, that shit is out now.
1970-01-01 00:13:39: AD and Sgt. J. Narg.
1970-01-01 00:13:41: Big shout out to Facts though, man,
1970-01-01 00:13:43: because after Southside shit, man, I
1970-01-01 00:13:45: always wanted to do some shit like this, man.
1970-01-01 00:13:47: Shout out to my boy, man.
1970-01-01 00:13:49: Y'all need to get him on here next, man.
1970-01-01 00:13:51: This nigga is a beast with the beats.
1970-01-01 00:13:53: God damn it, Dupree, man. He's crazy.
1970-01-01 00:13:55: So y'all gotta get him on here too.
