1970-01-01 00:00:00: Hi, I'm Chamseudin and we're at ADE and this is my against the clock for Fact TV.
1970-01-01 00:00:19: These are the chord memory.
1970-01-01 00:10:19: How do you think it went?
1970-01-01 00:10:35: I have no idea actually.
1970-01-01 00:10:40: This is my jam set up for a while now and I try to make it as simple as possible, not too much stuff going on so I just know where to go quickly.
1970-01-01 00:10:53: I don't know. I'd have to hear it back first.
1970-01-01 00:11:01: Is there anything that didn't go the way you thought it was going to go?
1970-01-01 00:11:07: Yeah, well if you're using modular and it's just jamming there's always unexpected things happening.
1970-01-01 00:11:19: I didn't get sound of some modules that I was hoping for.
1970-01-01 00:11:24: And what about the 10 minutes?
1970-01-01 00:11:28: So short.
1970-01-01 00:11:30: Did you feel the pressure?
1970-01-01 00:11:32: I felt it, definitely. It was real.
1970-01-01 00:11:36: I tried it at home to be honest.
1970-01-01 00:11:44: But it came quicker, the 10 minutes were over quicker than I expected anyway.
1970-01-01 00:11:49: It was really fun to do.
1970-01-01 00:11:52: It seems you did a lot with a very short amount of time.
1970-01-01 00:11:57: I usually stretch all this out over a set that lasts an hour or a little longer.
1970-01-01 00:12:03: I just scrammed it all in 10 minutes.
1970-01-01 00:12:06: So normally what I do is when I'm in the studio I have the same set up and I record all the separate channels into my computer.
1970-01-01 00:12:17: I just jam for an hour or longer until you have the idea that you hit gold or something and then I edit the track from that.
1970-01-01 00:12:25: So I start to just take the multi-track and I just cut it and arrange it.
1970-01-01 00:12:31: Yeah, this is really raw.
1970-01-01 00:12:33: But it works, that's what I wanted.
1970-01-01 00:12:35: That's how it's done.
1970-01-01 00:12:37: Thank you.
