1970-01-01 00:00:00: I'm Stay Positive and I'm going against the clock for Fact TV.
1970-01-01 00:00:30: I usually start by finding a sound that's interesting.
1970-01-01 00:01:00: Stick some reverb on it.
1970-01-01 00:01:30: Nice chord progression, usually with tenths.
1970-01-01 00:01:45: Fix it.
1970-01-01 00:02:00: This sounds nice, and I'm going to do more reverb.
1970-01-01 00:02:15: Finish those arpeggios, the pace is obviously faster.
1970-01-01 00:04:00: So, I'll call that in.
1970-01-01 00:04:27: I've really deleted everything I've done so far, that would have been a bit of a disaster.
1970-01-01 00:05:57: So, I'll call that in.
1970-01-01 00:06:12: So, I'll call that in.
1970-01-01 00:06:42: So, I'll call that in.
1970-01-01 00:07:12: How much time have I got?
1970-01-01 00:07:24: Okay, just a two and a half minutes.
1970-01-01 00:07:54: This is a bit cheeky.
1970-01-01 00:08:17: I just happen to know that there's a particular sample of this that's really good here.
1970-01-01 00:08:23: But I don't think I should really legally have it.
1970-01-01 00:08:27: So, maybe we can just cut this out.
1970-01-01 00:09:23: So, I'll call that in.
1970-01-01 00:09:53: Okay.
1970-01-01 00:10:00: Okay.
1970-01-01 00:10:17: Okay.
1970-01-01 00:10:31: I really like the absinthe plugin.
1970-01-01 00:10:37: It's like a fairly standard issue soft synth.
1970-01-01 00:10:42: But it has lots of really nice atmospheric sounds.
1970-01-01 00:10:45: I mean, I just have a little favorites list that I went through when I first started to find something that had a bit of atmosphere about it.
1970-01-01 00:10:54: Because that's always my jumping off point.
1970-01-01 00:10:56: Like, something that makes you kind of feel something.
1970-01-01 00:10:59: And then I just go around playing loads of tenths because they're just blatantly the best interval.
1970-01-01 00:11:04: And messing around with a chord sequence until something fits.
1970-01-01 00:11:08: Which is how I got that.
1970-01-01 00:11:14: Which is not massively imaginative.
1970-01-01 00:11:17: But, you know, it does the job.
1970-01-01 00:11:20: Then I use a machine for the beats, which I only got recently actually.
1970-01-01 00:11:24: But I don't really use the hardware.
1970-01-01 00:11:26: I just really like the sequencer.
1970-01-01 00:11:28: I like the samples that come with it.
1970-01-01 00:11:30: Just throw a beat together in there.
1970-01-01 00:11:35: Just the standard Logic Klopp Geist plugin for the bass.
1970-01-01 00:11:43: Just a sign.
1970-01-01 00:11:45: So just nice and clear.
1970-01-01 00:11:47: Just really basic.
1970-01-01 00:11:50: And I use for the pad that I put in at the end that I didn't quite get a chance to finish off with.
1970-01-01 00:11:54: I used a FX expansion fuser.
1970-01-01 00:11:58: Which is a nice kind of analogue sounding plugin.
1970-01-01 00:12:04: Which I also got quite recently.
1970-01-01 00:12:06: That's pretty much it apart from the massively illegal sample that I used.
1970-01-01 00:12:10: Which we won't say any more about.
1970-01-01 00:12:13: Which just happened to fit in this key signature and this time signature.
1970-01-01 00:12:16: So that was pretty good luck.
1970-01-01 00:12:19: I wanted to side chain the pad, but I didn't have time.
1970-01-01 00:12:22: I would have made it sit a bit better in the mix and give it a bit more rhythm.
1970-01-01 00:12:28: But yeah, ran out of time.
1970-01-01 00:12:30: I would have liked to have done some little counter melody things as well.
1970-01-01 00:12:33: But 10 minutes is quite short.
1970-01-01 00:12:36: So yeah, that's that.
