1970-01-01 00:10:35: wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild
1970-01-01 00:10:43: That's like a little vibe.
1970-01-01 00:10:44: That's how I usually kind of like start making shit.
1970-01-01 00:10:47: It's good you know what I mean.
1970-01-01 00:10:48: I've recently just set up the studio in this way
1970-01-01 00:10:52: where I can kind of like just go between each room
1970-01-01 00:10:54: and just you know what I mean.
1970-01-01 00:10:55: Just kind of like touch things
1970-01-01 00:10:56: and just kind of get away from the computer a bit so.
1970-01-01 00:10:59: Like sampling and all of that is always been
1970-01-01 00:11:02: like a thing that I've been into just for like ten on table this year
1970-01-01 00:11:05: and all that shit from way back in the day.
1970-01-01 00:11:07: So it was always kind of like the centerpiece,
1970-01-01 00:11:09: like DJ Shadow style, you know what I mean?
1970-01-01 00:11:11: I was really into DJ Shadow, I loved all the
1970-01-01 00:11:13: Tri-Pop shit.
1970-01-01 00:11:16: What I'm trying to just base a lot of my writing around
1970-01-01 00:11:19: is just writing on the guitar really,
1970-01-01 00:11:22: and just taking bits from where I've come from
1970-01-01 00:11:24: to where I'm going, you know what I mean?
1970-01-01 00:11:26: Just kind of mix it up, because that is definitely
1970-01-01 00:11:30: what I'm feeling.
1970-01-01 00:11:31: It's kind of wanted to try and incorporate as much
1970-01-01 00:11:33: as what I do is possible, just to kind of give everyone
1970-01-01 00:11:37: a clear idea of not just sort of one sort of artist.
1970-01-01 00:11:41: Great Piano Legends, and I feel like it is Thelonious Monk,
1970-01-01 00:11:46: I feel like it is, but I can be totally wrong
1970-01-01 00:11:48: because there's loads of punk people in here.
1970-01-01 00:11:50: I just basically took a piece from there,
1970-01-01 00:11:53: a little kind of like groovy bit that kind of caught my eye.
1970-01-01 00:11:56: Kind of found a little riff on the guitar
1970-01-01 00:11:59: to try and marry the two sort of thing.
1970-01-01 00:12:01: I mean, it was so quick, I just kind of feel like
1970-01-01 00:12:03: it was just kind of happened mad quick.
1970-01-01 00:12:05: I mean, caught a little bass line,
1970-01-01 00:12:07: had a little melody on the guitar.
1970-01-01 00:12:10: I mean, it was pretty simple stuff, you know what I mean?
1970-01-01 00:12:12: But it was just like, I like to be able to take
1970-01-01 00:12:16: idea of sampling and not just be like,
1970-01-01 00:12:18: yeah, I'm gonna make a beat, you know what I mean?
1970-01-01 00:12:20: I can do that and shit, it's like, I find it fun
1970-01-01 00:12:23: and all of that, but I'm gonna be able to like
1970-01-01 00:12:24: take it elsewhere.
