1970-01-01 00:11:22: So, okay, just to say, when I play live, I don't bring everything in my studio.
1970-01-01 00:11:40: I usually bring two boxes in the Atari's, maximum three.
1970-01-01 00:11:46: And I don't have as large a mixer, obviously.
1970-01-01 00:11:49: And so I thought today was a chance to incorporate as much as I could.
1970-01-01 00:11:55: And so I was using the Yamaha V50, and for the first time, actually, as a live performance
1970-01-01 00:12:06: tool, turning on and off channels.
1970-01-01 00:12:10: What I didn't get to do in 10 minutes is start messing with the sample start point in this
1970-01-01 00:12:16: boogie woogie guy, which I wanted to do because he's really funny.
1970-01-01 00:12:22: And nor was this audible, but I had George Michael, Careless Whisperer, on there.
1970-01-01 00:12:30: There's the memory man on a few of the operators on this synth here.
1970-01-01 00:12:37: And then there's this delay that is on some of the drums and synths.
1970-01-01 00:12:43: And then there's these three different delays here.
1970-01-01 00:12:46: And then there's also another delay in here.
1970-01-01 00:12:49: And then there's also a delay there for the samplers.
1970-01-01 00:12:53: Oh, and then there's also this delay that does some nice feedback between itself, because
1970-01-01 00:13:01: it's a dual digital delay that you can patch in the back to feedback into itself in different
1970-01-01 00:13:06: ways.
1970-01-01 00:13:12: And then there's MIDI delay.
1970-01-01 00:13:14: MIDI delay coming from here.
1970-01-01 00:13:20: And that's it.
1970-01-01 00:13:21: That's it today.
1970-01-01 00:13:22: No other MIDI delay.
1970-01-01 00:13:23: But when you hear that thing go, it's this MIDI delay feeding back seven times with minus
1970-01-01 00:13:36: nine velocity every time it goes.
1970-01-01 00:13:54: Overloaded a little.
1970-01-01 00:14:24: I start them at the same time, and I have the tempos not the same, but one is divided
1970-01-01 00:14:30: by two of the other.
1970-01-01 00:14:32: But I can do more complicated combinations when I want one spitting out MIDI at three-quarters
1970-01-01 00:14:39: of the MIDI, but then at four-thirds of the speed of the tempo of this one, or things
1970-01-01 00:14:45: like this.
1970-01-01 00:14:47: And then those two MIDI signals are merged into a merger that then goes into a clock
1970-01-01 00:14:55: divider that then divides everything by two, and then that's how it plays nice after I've
1970-01-01 00:15:01: done this MIDI math here.
1970-01-01 00:15:05: What the program does is on six tracks give me, depending on what channel I choose, different
1970-01-01 00:15:14: different melodies based on a core, let's say like riff.
1970-01-01 00:15:20: So each one of these has its own riff, and then I am giving out combinations of that
1970-01-01 00:15:25: riff either to drums or synthesizers.
1970-01-01 00:15:30: And they're tuned to 432 hertz for the middle C instead of 440 hertz, so they don't play
1970-01-01 00:15:39: nice with, for example, one of my synths that I can't do custom tuning on.
1970-01-01 00:15:45: And then it's tuned to the Pythagorean three-halves ratio for a pure, let's say Pythagorean ditonic
1970-01-01 00:15:56: scale.
1970-01-01 00:15:57: And I find in rooms that are especially rooms with arches like this that it resonates better
1970-01-01 00:16:02: than a normal standard equal temperament synthesizer.
1970-01-01 00:16:11: Anyway, I feel with the music that I can't describe it exactly.
1970-01-01 00:16:20: I usually like when I do a live set, it's more than 10 minutes, and I start to get more
1970-01-01 00:16:26: musical with the thing, and I start changing the key of each one of these so that they
1970-01-01 00:16:30: can kind of consonance and dissonance with each other.
1970-01-01 00:16:35: And I start to do that, I think, right about here, here.
1970-01-01 00:17:30: Doing some nice fill presets I've made with these pedals, like on an old 80s keyboard
1970-01-01 00:17:39: when you were a kid and you had intro fill button.
1970-01-01 00:17:43: It's like this but more advanced here.
1970-01-01 00:17:52: This is like my little cheat sheet.
1970-01-01 00:17:56: This is this program that just shows on all 16 channels what MIDI is coming out.
1970-01-01 00:18:04: So then visually I can look at it when I'm generating random melodies in different keys,
1970-01-01 00:18:11: how they're going to be out of key, and whether I should change the scale that they're in,
1970-01-01 00:18:15: because it's a seven-tone scale that each of these are on, and I can change it, say,
1970-01-01 00:18:18: from harmonic minor to Hungarian to esoteric to whatever special one I've made, choosing
1970-01-01 00:18:23: from the 12 notes in the octave.
1970-01-01 00:18:26: And so I can kind of decide what key I have it in and what scale I have it in so that
1970-01-01 00:18:31: these two different riffs that say I like and I want to work together can work together.
1970-01-01 00:18:36: I can set them both on channel four and then see that one needs to go up or one needs to
1970-01-01 00:18:43: go slightly down.
1970-01-01 00:18:46: So it's a quick tool just to help things move along in a melodic way so that I don't spend
1970-01-01 00:18:54: hours of hard listening with the distorted sounds.
1970-01-01 00:19:02: It's called MIDI display.
