1970-01-01 00:00:00: Hi, it's Philipp Eftemann and I'm playing against the clock now.
1970-01-01 00:00:13: So first of all we have to load the sound with my sampler.
1970-01-01 00:00:28: It takes a while. Load it!
1970-01-01 00:00:31: Okay.
1970-01-01 00:00:37: Yeah.
1970-01-01 00:00:41: Let's see.
1970-01-01 00:00:58: Okay.
1970-01-01 00:01:28: Okay.
1970-01-01 00:01:58: Okay.
1970-01-01 00:02:28: Okay.
1970-01-01 00:02:58: Okay.
1970-01-01 00:03:28: Okay.
1970-01-01 00:03:58: Okay.
1970-01-01 00:04:28: Okay.
1970-01-01 00:04:58: Okay.
1970-01-01 00:05:28: Okay.
1970-01-01 00:05:58: Okay.
1970-01-01 00:06:28: Okay.
1970-01-01 00:06:58: Okay.
1970-01-01 00:07:28: Okay.
1970-01-01 00:07:58: Okay.
1970-01-01 00:08:28: Okay.
1970-01-01 00:08:58: Okay.
1970-01-01 00:09:28: Okay.
1970-01-01 00:09:58: Ten minutes. It's over. Oh no.
1970-01-01 00:10:28: Thanks for watching.
1970-01-01 00:10:39: Hello. I just finished my ten minutes for fact. It was lots of fun and went pretty quick.
1970-01-01 00:10:47: I could have played longer honestly, but I hope you liked it.
1970-01-01 00:10:51: And I just want to show you some of my main instruments that I'm using in my studio.
1970-01-01 00:11:00: And this is one of the first effects that I bought from one of the first DJ gigs where I got some money.
1970-01-01 00:11:12: I bought the Space Echo, which was quite cheap at the time, 12 years ago.
1970-01-01 00:11:18: And all the stuff here I bought over the years, over the last ten years and slowly learned how to use it.
1970-01-01 00:11:29: Because when I started making music as FDMEN, I didn't have any kind of analog hardware and had no money.
1970-01-01 00:11:39: I just had a little IBM computer and yeah, with Cubase. That's how I make music.
1970-01-01 00:11:49: And now that I have some great machines, I still kind of make the same music, I think.
1970-01-01 00:11:58: But it's way more fun because I can turn all the knobs while I'm doing it.
1970-01-01 00:12:03: So I try to get away from the computer.
1970-01-01 00:12:07: And this is the set that I just played. It's just out of the box.
1970-01-01 00:12:13: I pre-programmed some patterns, of course, because in ten minutes you can't program the whole track.
1970-01-01 00:12:20: I mean you can, but not if you use some harmonic elements. I think that it's not so easy.
1970-01-01 00:12:30: And yeah, it's all based around my 808 and 909 drum machines, which I love.
1970-01-01 00:12:39: And I think they are completely timeless and I don't want anything else.
1970-01-01 00:12:45: And then I had my favorite Akai sampler, the S612, where I loaded some samples from the, what is it called?
1970-01-01 00:12:58: Quickdisk, I think it's from 1985 or something. The sampler is from 1986, if I remember right.
1970-01-01 00:13:08: And it is the best machine to get, I think, because it's so simple.
1970-01-01 00:13:13: It has no like, it's just everything is on the front.
1970-01-01 00:13:20: Like you have a filter and a decay, a modulation and start and stop. That's basically it.
1970-01-01 00:13:25: And you don't need anything else, I think.
1970-01-01 00:13:28: And this sampler runs through the Space Echo.
1970-01-01 00:13:34: And yeah, that's pretty much it with that one.
1970-01-01 00:13:41: And it's controlled, everything is kind of controlled by this little beauty here.
1970-01-01 00:13:46: It's called the Zirclon from Sequentix. It's a Scottish manufacturer.
1970-01-01 00:13:52: It's all handmade and I had to wait for nearly one year to get it.
1970-01-01 00:13:56: And this one has an outbreak cable to my modular synth, where I have all the control voltages and triggers going to wherever I want.
1970-01-01 00:14:07: And this is the great thing about it. It has MIDI and sync and CV.
1970-01-01 00:14:12: And so I can basically control everything from within this machine and it's kind of like my computer, like Ableton or something.
1970-01-01 00:14:21: But it's very different because I can program everything with knobs and keys.
1970-01-01 00:14:28: And I really like it. And it has a great timing as well.
1970-01-01 00:14:33: And so this one, for example, goes into the CV and then goes straight into my 101, which makes the soft bass line sound.
1970-01-01 00:14:44: And then we have some weird modulated toms, which go through ring modulators.
1970-01-01 00:14:52: And this is the great Simmons electronic drum synth, where you have like four instances and they all are triggered by audio.
1970-01-01 00:15:04: And so this one is triggered by the 808 toms and plays along with everything in sync.
1970-01-01 00:15:11: That's basically it. I have some more effects that I'm using from time to time.
1970-01-01 00:15:16: And my great, this is my little beauty.
1970-01-01 00:15:19: Still very cheap. If you need a nice FM synth, you should get this one because this is a little DX7 inside.
1970-01-01 00:15:27: It has all the Detroit techno presets in there. You can do everything from Robert Hood to Jeff Mills.
1970-01-01 00:15:34: Easy. You should get it. Yes. Thank you.
