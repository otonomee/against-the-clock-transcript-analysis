1970-01-01 00:00:00: I'm Josh Posthuman and I'm going to go against the clock for FACTV.
1970-01-01 00:00:13: Okay, start off with the 707.
1970-01-01 00:00:18: Best drum machine in the business. This one's a bit knackered though, but I still love it.
1970-01-01 00:00:26: Some toms.
1970-01-01 00:00:36: Some hi-hats.
1970-01-01 00:00:44: And flaps.
1970-01-01 00:00:48: A couple of room shots in here.
1970-01-01 00:00:56: And ride.
1970-01-01 00:01:04: Okay, sounds alright. Now I need to shift this back onto track play to get the MIDI sync back onto the computer because it doesn't like doing both.
1970-01-01 00:01:17: Yay, we're in.
1970-01-01 00:01:19: Okay, now for the 303. This is the Cyclone TT303, which is my favourite clone for those that can't afford a real 303.
1970-01-01 00:01:30: Two-man, I think they are now.
1970-01-01 00:01:47: Sounds alright.
1970-01-01 00:02:07: Okay, I'm going to copy and paste that onto some empty patterns so I can get a few little variations on it.
1970-01-01 00:02:17: And on there.
1970-01-01 00:02:25: And on there.
1970-01-01 00:02:37: Alright, let's see how they sound together.
1970-01-01 00:02:47: Alright, sounds okay. You stay there.
1970-01-01 00:02:55: Alright, let's get some kick drums in there.
1970-01-01 00:03:04: And maybe some hats.
1970-01-01 00:03:17: Some hi-hats.
1970-01-01 00:03:37: Right, hats.
1970-01-01 00:03:40: Some hi-hats.
1970-01-01 00:03:45: Cheers.
1970-01-01 00:03:48: And some hi-hats.
1970-01-01 00:03:53: Right.
1970-01-01 00:04:10: This is the new Juno 106 clone, the boutique one. I really like the original, but I had to sell it. And this one was a good replacement.
1970-01-01 00:04:40: Let's get a little cowbell written there, shall we?
1970-01-01 00:04:50: Alright, that's a lot better.
1970-01-01 00:05:10: And that's a lot better.
1970-01-01 00:05:40: Alright, let's get some kick drums in there.
1970-01-01 00:05:44: And maybe some hi-hats.
1970-01-01 00:05:49: And some hi-hats.
1970-01-01 00:05:53: And some hi-hats.

1970-01-01 00:10:01: There we go, quick 303 jam, 10 minutes.
1970-01-01 00:10:24: Started off just with the 707, which is a bit knackered because it's got no bass, it's
1970-01-01 00:10:30: gaffer taped together. Got a beat together on that and then wrote an acid line on the
1970-01-01 00:10:35: TT303, which is the cyclone analogic clone of the TB303 because the real 303 is too grand.
1970-01-01 00:10:45: But this one's, it's like a 303 but with a quick silver CPU I guess, it's pretty good.
1970-01-01 00:10:53: And then chucked a few extra beats over the top of that with the 909, just kind of jammed
1970-01-01 00:10:58: those a bit. Then I took the JU06, the boutique, which is the clone, it's the copy of the
1970-01-01 00:11:05: old Juno 106, which I used to have and had to sell. Bought that instead, sounds great.
1970-01-01 00:11:12: Put some pads in with that and then after that I just picked up a few noises, an old
1970-01-01 00:11:18: cowbell sample, some clicks of an old amp-ham radio and a weird old loop and just kind of
1970-01-01 00:11:24: tried to put them on there to give it a little bit more sort of substance and jammed it away
1970-01-01 00:11:29: really. I didn't really know where I was going to go with it. I normally wouldn't write a
1970-01-01 00:11:33: track this quickly but it sounded alright, it was good fun. I could probably have carried
1970-01-01 00:11:38: on for another half an hour and come up with something.
