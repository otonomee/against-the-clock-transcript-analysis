1970-01-01 00:00:00: Hey everyone, I'm Higo, a music producer from Lagos, Nigeria and I'm here to do
1970-01-01 00:00:06: FACT against the clock. It takes me about 30 minutes to put down a demo but to be
1970-01-01 00:00:11: okay with it maybe 45 minutes. I have to close it and come back to it to know that it
1970-01-01 00:00:17: sounds right. I'm just gonna do this for the challenge. I just feel like the
1970-01-01 00:00:25: chords are gonna be as good as always. It's just the drums maybe. Weird. Because it's limited time.
1970-01-01 00:00:31: The mood is gonna be happy. That's all. Yeah. It's just happy moods. Alright so I'm
1970-01-01 00:00:38: Higo. This is FACT against the clock. So let's go.
1970-01-01 00:01:38: Oh
1970-01-01 00:02:08: Oh
1970-01-01 00:02:38: Oh
1970-01-01 00:03:08: Oh
1970-01-01 00:03:38: Oh
1970-01-01 00:04:08: Oh
1970-01-01 00:04:38: Oh
1970-01-01 00:05:08: Oh
1970-01-01 00:05:38: Oh
1970-01-01 00:06:08: Oh
1970-01-01 00:06:38: Oh
1970-01-01 00:07:08: Oh
1970-01-01 00:07:38: Oh
1970-01-01 00:08:08: Oh
1970-01-01 00:08:38: Oh
1970-01-01 00:09:08: Oh
1970-01-01 00:09:38: Oh
1970-01-01 00:10:08: Oh
1970-01-01 00:10:38: Oh
1970-01-01 00:11:08: I know it's done though. Yeah?
1970-01-01 00:11:12: Very short.
1970-01-01 00:11:16: That was so short.
1970-01-01 00:11:20: But yeah, I think this is, it sounds like something I can finish later.
1970-01-01 00:11:26: You know, because it has a vibe to it. I feel like it has a vibe that I'll come back to.
1970-01-01 00:11:33: Maybe bass somewhere in the middle.
1970-01-01 00:11:37: And probably change the main sound.
1970-01-01 00:11:42: Probably change. It's like the main synth to something else.
1970-01-01 00:11:47: It was fun. It was interesting.
1970-01-01 00:11:50: Because usually when I make beats in 10 minutes, that's just on my own wheel.
1970-01-01 00:11:55: Oh this just happened. But I haven't had to be timed to do that.
1970-01-01 00:12:01: First chord progression that made sense to me. That's what I just put down.
1970-01-01 00:12:06: Normally I would play around with a couple more, see other stuff that fits.
1970-01-01 00:12:13: Then pick. Normally I would make like two beats in one.
1970-01-01 00:12:17: And I'll probably forget about the first one.
1970-01-01 00:12:21: This has been my episode on Facts Against the Clock.
1970-01-01 00:12:27: I'm Hego, music producer from Lagos, Nigeria. Thank you.
1970-01-01 00:12:50: You
