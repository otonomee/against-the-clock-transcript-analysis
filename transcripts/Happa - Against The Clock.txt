1970-01-01 00:06:25: Probably should have
1970-01-01 00:06:27: And another one
1970-01-01 00:06:35: Where is the
1970-01-01 00:06:39: I've been on this one
1970-01-01 00:09:11: Let's try and get one more loop in.
1970-01-01 00:09:21: If you're ready, we can go on a magical journey.
1970-01-01 00:09:41: If you're ready.
1970-01-01 00:09:45: If you're ready.
1970-01-01 00:09:49: If you're ready.
1970-01-01 00:09:52: If you're ready.
1970-01-01 00:10:11: Let's go.
1970-01-01 00:10:16: Cool.
1970-01-01 00:10:19: Bit sweaty.
1970-01-01 00:10:26: I just started making these loops a few weeks ago basically.
1970-01-01 00:10:30: I found out how to do it online.
1970-01-01 00:10:32: And I thought it would just be a nice twist against the clock.
1970-01-01 00:10:35: And actually my parents' tapes.
1970-01-01 00:10:38: I just kind of nicked them and re-recorded over or left the original material on.
1970-01-01 00:10:42: So on some sides there will be like a drum machine or a synth recorded on the loop.
1970-01-01 00:10:47: And then on the other side there will be some weird haunting vocal loop or something.
1970-01-01 00:10:52: Yeah, I just love all the imperfections that come with the format that is tape.
1970-01-01 00:10:59: It's just kind of like everything sounds a little bit rubbish in a really lovely way.
1970-01-01 00:11:04: Like when you just have that constant hiss.
1970-01-01 00:11:06: And I just like the way it kind of crunches and saturates things together.
1970-01-01 00:11:10: Like if you record a drum beat on it, everything just kind of crunches and molds together.
1970-01-01 00:11:16: So I do like to, within my productions, I like to record a lot on and off of tape.
