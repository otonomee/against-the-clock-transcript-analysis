1970-01-01 00:00:00: I feel like I giggle too much in these situations but the pressure is on so
1970-01-01 00:00:12: be serious gonna get my hard-faced electronic music producer this is
1970-01-01 00:00:22: Daedalus and we're gonna go against the clock for FACTV
1970-01-01 00:00:27: Alright let's start with our tempo and take our leisurely time because we
1970-01-01 00:00:35: haven't a time no time at all
1970-01-01 00:00:38: Let's make a MIDI track. All right what do we want to do?
1970-01-01 00:00:51: I'm using Pro Tools today and I have no idea what it's gonna sound like
1970-01-01 00:01:21: okay
1970-01-01 00:03:51: all right so we start
1970-01-01 00:04:04: let's come with a keyboard part
1970-01-01 00:04:34: all right this might be noisy
1970-01-01 00:05:04: I like that last one
1970-01-01 00:05:34: let's make this sound different
1970-01-01 00:07:34: hmm
1970-01-01 00:09:34: Just a little time to spare.
1970-01-01 00:10:03: Just to be the very beginning of the process.
1970-01-01 00:10:05: The very, very beginning of the process, but there's a little ditty.
1970-01-01 00:10:10: You know, I think every time I come to the studio I try to keep things fresh and open.
1970-01-01 00:10:14: I didn't know melodically where to go, but I did have some techniques in mind that I wanted to explore.
1970-01-01 00:10:18: The Circuitbend 606 and the Roland VoCoder, their reissued VoCoder.
1970-01-01 00:10:23: I just wanted to explore it. I don't know if they would end up being worthy of being included, but it felt like something authentic to me.
1970-01-01 00:10:30: And then the Rhodes, just again, fingers on instruments.
1970-01-01 00:10:34: I think it's really important to me. It's a big part of what I do.
1970-01-01 00:10:37: I like to show the scenes of the production. Maybe not so many scenes as this.
1970-01-01 00:10:41: Maybe not so threadbare, so to speak, but that's kind of the thing, right?
1970-01-01 00:10:47: I think that's what this is all about. Against the Clock is all about what's the essential beginning building blocks of someone's ideals.
1970-01-01 00:10:54: And I'm really proud to take part in them.
1970-01-01 00:10:57: You know, I don't feel like I felt the clock at first.
1970-01-01 00:10:59: I don't feel like the clock ticking was really like in the back of my brain until it started to come to a close.
1970-01-01 00:11:05: Until we got to that last minute. It was just normal production.
1970-01-01 00:11:09: Usually you're chasing an idea anyways, and so you're kind of in the moment.
1970-01-01 00:11:12: And in my mind I appraised it as being, oh, 10 minutes is forever.
1970-01-01 00:11:16: I feel pretty fast at Pro Tools. That's why I decided to go with it actually.
1970-01-01 00:11:20: In the first place it's a little bit of arcane program, and it's not used in this kind of way super often.
1970-01-01 00:11:25: I mean, I use Ableton sometimes too, but I'm just not as fast on it.
1970-01-01 00:11:28: So I thought, OK, quick, speedy, 10 minutes is plenty of time to get some ideas down.
1970-01-01 00:11:33: And then when it came down to it, that last minute felt like I had taken three breaths and then there it was in the fourth.
1970-01-01 00:11:39: It was guillotine.
1970-01-01 00:11:41: And I don't think I had gotten as far as I would have chosen or would have liked.
1970-01-01 00:11:45: But hey, I mean, that's just the honest truth, right?
1970-01-01 00:11:49: I think if I were to take this further, I would filter all the drums.
1970-01-01 00:11:54: I would take some of the wildness out, but leave all the hands, right?
1970-01-01 00:11:57: All the missteps and hands that kind of remain.
1970-01-01 00:12:00: That's the interesting part to me.
1970-01-01 00:12:02: Maybe melodically, I mean, we need a B section bad, but 10 minutes is not good enough for a B section.
1970-01-01 00:12:08: No resolution, just a figure.
1970-01-01 00:12:11: No melody, just harmony.
1970-01-01 00:12:14: But hey, you know, 10 minutes against the clock.
1970-01-01 00:12:24: Thank you.
