1970-01-01 00:00:00: Yeah I'm Halogenix and I'm going against the clock for FACT TV.
1970-01-01 00:00:12: Right so I'm going to start off with some drums.
1970-01-01 00:00:19: Okay.
1970-01-01 00:00:26: Alright.
1970-01-01 00:00:38: Let's chop these up a bit.
1970-01-01 00:00:48: Okay.
1970-01-01 00:00:54: Interesting.
1970-01-01 00:01:06: And crash, I need that here.
1970-01-01 00:01:11: Whoa.
1970-01-01 00:01:14: Okay.
1970-01-01 00:01:25: Alright.
1970-01-01 00:01:28: Whoa.
1970-01-01 00:01:51: Alright.
1970-01-01 00:02:01: Maybe start that over here.
1970-01-01 00:02:11: Actually don't want to start that over as well.
1970-01-01 00:02:27: Okay.
1970-01-01 00:02:30: Alright, where else you got?
1970-01-01 00:02:34: So, where else?
1970-01-01 00:02:39: Alright.
1970-01-01 00:03:09: Sounds alright, sounds a bit fucked.
1970-01-01 00:03:34: Alright.
1970-01-01 00:04:02: Okay.
1970-01-01 00:04:17: That's cool, actually I might put that in there.
1970-01-01 00:04:20: Where is it? That one.
1970-01-01 00:04:25: Chop that, move that.
1970-01-01 00:04:28: That's cool.
1970-01-01 00:04:57: That doesn't sound right.
1970-01-01 00:05:24: That's better.
1970-01-01 00:05:35: That's cool.
1970-01-01 00:05:58: That's not good.
1970-01-01 00:06:25: That's not good.
1970-01-01 00:06:35: That's not good.
1970-01-01 00:07:02: That's not good.
1970-01-01 00:07:26: That was dope.
1970-01-01 00:07:44: That's not good.
1970-01-01 00:07:57: That's not good.
1970-01-01 00:08:21: That's not good.
1970-01-01 00:08:48: Alright, where else, where else, where else?
1970-01-01 00:08:50: Let's drag this back, take out those, maybe do that, make that one.
1970-01-01 00:08:58: Where else have I got this sample folder?
1970-01-01 00:09:02: Foley, yes please.
1970-01-01 00:09:04: Foley, Foley, Foley.
1970-01-01 00:09:06: Stick you in there.
1970-01-01 00:09:08: Hurry up.
1970-01-01 00:09:10: Fantastic.
1970-01-01 00:09:13: Turn it down.
1970-01-01 00:09:26: Nice.
1970-01-01 00:09:35: Alright, let's move those over there.
1970-01-01 00:09:38: Move that into one, loop you out.
1970-01-01 00:09:43: Do that, loop that.
1970-01-01 00:09:45: Do that, do that, do that.
1970-01-01 00:09:52: Fingers crossed.
1970-01-01 00:10:00: Shit, it's never fucking.
1970-01-01 00:10:16: Nailed it.
1970-01-01 00:10:23: I'm used to just like having no constraints on what I do, so you know, if this had been like a fly on the wall, it probably would have just had kick drum after kick drum for about 10 minutes.
1970-01-01 00:10:34: But that wouldn't have made for a very interesting video, so yeah, it was cool.
1970-01-01 00:10:37: It was nerve wracking.
1970-01-01 00:10:38: I could feel myself, you know, having to, you know, discard ideas that I may have kind of delved deeper into, so it's probably not the, kind of the best, but you know, it was, I think something cool came out of it.
1970-01-01 00:10:50: I think I love it.
