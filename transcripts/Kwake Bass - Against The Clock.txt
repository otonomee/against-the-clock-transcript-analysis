1970-01-01 00:00:00: Can I do this? Can I go like that?
1970-01-01 00:00:11: Well that's pretty close but...
1970-01-01 00:00:14: Start it like that and then I'll sit down. That's kind of crazy innit?
1970-01-01 00:00:19: This is my 10 minute challenge, 10 minute against the clock challenge. What am I supposed
1970-01-01 00:00:24: to say? Sorry I forgot to fuck that up.
1970-01-01 00:00:27: This is Quake Bass against the clock. Let's do it.
1970-01-01 00:03:57: How long?
1970-01-01 00:10:44: I actually enjoyed the pressure of it. I like to think that it makes you build something
1970-01-01 00:10:54: quite seamless because of how I intended to do it. I didn't want to have anything too
1970-01-01 00:11:00: pre-arranged. I just wanted to have sounds that are vaguely in a space and then just
1970-01-01 00:11:05: whatever melodically happens. So I like to just let boxes get interactive and do shit.
1970-01-01 00:11:11: I would have had more of that going on. But that's what I'm saying, that's what's good
1970-01-01 00:11:16: about it is it kind of makes you just think what is the most useful thing for you to do
1970-01-01 00:11:20: right now.
1970-01-01 00:11:21: I write in all different ways man. I like to use everything and get all the shit out
1970-01-01 00:11:28: and be like yeah, loads of shit everywhere. Loads of instruments and loads of things
1970-01-01 00:11:34: doing really little bits to then create a bigger thing.
