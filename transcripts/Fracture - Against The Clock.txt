1970-01-01 00:00:00: Okay, this is Fracture and I'm here with FACT TV. I'm about to go against the clock. I'm
1970-01-01 00:00:15: going to do it slightly differently this time. I'm outside my favourite record shop, Eldica
1970-01-01 00:00:19: in Dalston and I'm going to buy a couple of records in which to sample back at the studio
1970-01-01 00:00:24: and do my beat. But they've only given me two minutes to search for records so let's
1970-01-01 00:00:27: get in there. Andy who works here has very nicely got me out a record which has got drums
1970-01-01 00:00:32: on it which may be cheating because it's not within the two minutes but it's dope so we'll
1970-01-01 00:00:38: have a quick listen to that. Alright so definitely going to use them. Something like rare groove
1970-01-01 00:00:44: Andy. Anything rare groovy? Leroy Hutchins. Have a listen to that. Acapellas. I need some sounds. I'm going to take that as well. That one, short trip to space. That's a beat, some sounds and an acapella. That's probably me but I'm just going to take this Leroy Hutchins thing out.
1970-01-01 00:01:14: I might be able to use that as well. Alright that's it. I've got my records so we're going to take a short trip to the studio and see what I can do with these.
1970-01-01 00:01:27: I'm going to start with this record, Kaleidoscope which is something that the guy in the shop Andy picked out for me. It's got some really really cool drums on it so that's kind of always a good place to start.
1970-01-01 00:01:42: If you're doing this sort of thing, if you've got some wicked drums then you're kind of halfway there. It's on track three I seem to remember. So I'm just recording straight into Ableton.
1970-01-01 00:01:52: Alright so there's drums and there was definitely something on this Leroy Hutchins record like some pretty slick kind of rare groove soul sort of stuff. There was definitely something on the beginning of this.
1970-01-01 00:02:22: So those parts there I think I might be able to chop those up and it's got like a nice these kind of short stabby parts there. I'm going to do something with those.
1970-01-01 00:02:36: I like that stab as well there and that kind of held sort of chord thing. Let's steal that. Now this is like an acapella thing so I'm quite excited about this because I reckon there's going to be some raw vibes on this.
1970-01-01 00:03:06: Get fresh and do the beatbox.
1970-01-01 00:03:34: Yep that's me. I might even leave them other drums alone.
1970-01-01 00:03:45: Alright let's move things on. So then there's one final record. Short trip to space. Kind of I don't know man some psychedelic vibes. It's probably going to be rubbish. It sounded alright in the shop.
1970-01-01 00:04:03: Might have a little skip in it but we'll try and be creative with that.
1970-01-01 00:04:14: Right so that's what I'm going to use. Some beats, some beatbox, some house. Alright so we're in. So I like that break beat but what I'm actually going to go in on is this beatbox thing here was killing me.
1970-01-01 00:04:39: Right so I'm going to go at like 160 tempo. Move this over. Right and I'm already mad nervous.
1970-01-01 00:04:51: So.
1970-01-01 00:05:03: That's the part I want.
1970-01-01 00:05:27: Alright let's get this drum beat in there.
1970-01-01 00:05:57: I'd usually go much more inwards on the chopping of that break beat but we don't quite have time so let's just see what we've got with these two rolling.
1970-01-01 00:06:26: So if I re-trigger that break on where that beatbox is kind of re-triggering.
1970-01-01 00:06:39: Okay it's mad loose but that's how we like it. Just tighten this up a touch being that snare in.
1970-01-01 00:07:04: So this second half here is a bit loose.
1970-01-01 00:07:19: Alright so then I've got some house stuff here if I'm right.
1970-01-01 00:07:24: Alright and I've got these Hutchins in. Okay let's go with this guy.
1970-01-01 00:07:38: Look at that. These are the wonders of things about sawing. And he just goes inside.
1970-01-01 00:07:48: Alright so I think what I'm actually going to do is be a bit more creative with that. I'm going to cut those hits real short.
1970-01-01 00:08:03: Tighten them up a little piece.
1970-01-01 00:08:06: How long have I got?
1970-01-01 00:08:08: We've got six minutes.
1970-01-01 00:08:09: Okay.
1970-01-01 00:08:23: So I can come out on another output on the desk.
1970-01-01 00:08:31: Add a little bit of reverb to it.
1970-01-01 00:08:39: Okay let's get this.
1970-01-01 00:09:09: Alright so that's like a kind of rough vibe sort of thing going on. I'm going to now add in some claps and some of that good shit.
1970-01-01 00:09:39: Okay.
1970-01-01 00:09:46: Let's get that in.
1970-01-01 00:10:10: Just them in.
1970-01-01 00:10:20: This is mad messy work but it's all good.
1970-01-01 00:10:26: Let's fling in a little hi-hat.
1970-01-01 00:10:32: What am I on? Like four minutes?
1970-01-01 00:10:56: Okay so that's going to be my kind of intro part. And if I can do it, if I've got time I'm going to make a little arrangement.
1970-01-01 00:11:05: So let's roll that out four sort of times. No break to start with.
1970-01-01 00:11:11: Let's just build that up a little piece.
1970-01-01 00:11:27: Okay then we'll have a little... what else does this chick say?
1970-01-01 00:11:39: That's mad cheesy.
1970-01-01 00:11:42: But I'm going to take it.
1970-01-01 00:11:49: That's going to take too long to fit that in. Alright so you know what?
1970-01-01 00:12:04: I'm going to put a little delay on this.
1970-01-01 00:12:16: Two minutes. Alright bassline. Quick smart.
1970-01-01 00:12:46: That's just too loose. I'm going to have to quantise that.
1970-01-01 00:13:00: Obviously it was set to eights.
1970-01-01 00:13:08: Okay so drop out this guy now.
1970-01-01 00:13:17: What are we on? One minute.
1970-01-01 00:13:21: Okay so we roll out that for a little bit.
1970-01-01 00:13:24: Then we roll out these beatboxy parts.
1970-01-01 00:13:31: Put this back in. Put this there. Bring the chick back in.
1970-01-01 00:13:39: Forty seconds. Forty seconds. Forty seconds.
1970-01-01 00:13:42: Okay then we'll have like another little roll out section.
1970-01-01 00:13:48: How have I got time?
1970-01-01 00:14:01: Twenty seconds. Oh shit I forgot to put those other little sounds in.
1970-01-01 00:14:09: That's going to go in like that. That's going to go in like that.
1970-01-01 00:14:16: That's what that sounds like.
1970-01-01 00:14:21: Alright and there we are. And that was hard.
