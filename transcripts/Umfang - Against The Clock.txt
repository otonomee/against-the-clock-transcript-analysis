1970-01-01 00:00:00: Hey, I'm Umfang.
1970-01-01 00:00:07: I'm going against the clock.
1970-01-01 00:00:30: I'm going against the clock.
1970-01-01 00:01:00: I'm going against the clock.
1970-01-01 00:01:30: I can't say I'm succeeding so far, but I'll keep trying.
1970-01-01 00:10:00: Cool, that's the power.
1970-01-01 00:10:19: Cool.
1970-01-01 00:10:20: So yeah, that could function as a song.
1970-01-01 00:10:28: I guess.
1970-01-01 00:10:31: I made a pattern.
1970-01-01 00:10:45: So I have a Boss DR-202 as my drum machine.
1970-01-01 00:10:52: It also has a bass line and I can pitch it up to be a melody as well.
1970-01-01 00:10:57: And then I'm running that with MIDI into the Zoxbox.
1970-01-01 00:11:04: So I can just make patterns that are basically like acid bass lines on the Zoxbox, but I
1970-01-01 00:11:09: don't really like the sound of the Zoxbox, like the quality of the sound, like the 303
1970-01-01 00:11:17: sound.
1970-01-01 00:11:18: So I just use that to basically sequence the microchord because I like the sounds it makes
1970-01-01 00:11:22: more.
1970-01-01 00:11:25: So yeah, it follows the path of the melody that I've made on the Zoxbox.
1970-01-01 00:11:31: And then I can just sort of choose the sound that I want to use and modify it.
1970-01-01 00:11:39: So my goal was just to make a drum pattern live.
1970-01-01 00:11:44: And then I used, I have a lot of patterns saved on the Zoxbox that I've already made.
1970-01-01 00:11:50: And I just sort of filtered through them to see which one fit the kind of mood of the
1970-01-01 00:11:57: drum pattern that I made.
1970-01-01 00:12:00: And then I made sure that the tone of this would go with the bass line that I made on
1970-01-01 00:12:06: this.
1970-01-01 00:12:07: So I saved that.
1970-01-01 00:12:08: So it's like I did the drum bits and then I found something over here and then I made
1970-01-01 00:12:13: just a really basic bass line underneath it.
1970-01-01 00:12:17: And I can modify the sound of each drum sound on here.
1970-01-01 00:12:20: So I modified the bass sound so it didn't sound so like Seinfeld-y because of the kit
1970-01-01 00:12:28: I picked.
1970-01-01 00:12:29: It's like a hip hop kit.
1970-01-01 00:12:31: So yeah, I like that I can just modify every sound individually on here.
1970-01-01 00:12:38: And then I use like mutes to play it basically.
1970-01-01 00:12:41: So it's like I can take out pieces.
1970-01-01 00:12:45: I can add reverb and delay to make it sound more dramatic.
1970-01-01 00:12:50: And then I can like reintroduce those pieces that I took out.
1970-01-01 00:12:59: I try to make like as simple music as possible.
1970-01-01 00:13:03: I like using just maybe two sounds or like two instruments going into Ableton.
1970-01-01 00:13:11: Yeah, I'm really inspired by like old hip hop and like contemporary hip hop that's on
1970-01-01 00:13:17: the radio.
1970-01-01 00:13:18: Just like the most pared down but like things that get in your head and you still think
1970-01-01 00:13:22: about them.
1970-01-01 00:13:25: So yeah, even though I play techno, like that's always kind of where my mind is.
1970-01-01 00:13:28: It's like a different place, like slower stuff.
1970-01-01 00:13:31: Like trip hop is really inspiring to me right now.
1970-01-01 00:13:36: Yeah, but I just kind of like to prove to people that like you can make music with whatever
1970-01-01 00:13:42: gear and a lot of people think of this drum machine as a toy.
1970-01-01 00:13:47: But I think it's like the love of my life and it's really powerful.
1970-01-01 00:13:50: I live in New York City.
1970-01-01 00:13:53: We're in Bed-Stuy right now at my studio.
1970-01-01 00:13:55: Yeah, the New York scene is thriving and like people do all kinds of insane stuff.
1970-01-01 00:14:03: It's amazing.
1970-01-01 00:14:04: I don't know.
1970-01-01 00:14:05: I try not to like name drop but like I just really like living in a place where there
1970-01-01 00:14:11: are so many influences that are constantly like bouncing off of each other.
1970-01-01 00:14:15: Like there's no one sound that dominates the club scene and you can see where people from
1970-01-01 00:14:22: different places come in and bring something new and it influences everything else.
1970-01-01 00:14:26: And yeah, I just love that.
1970-01-01 00:14:29: And that like the scene here I feel like every time I go out I kind of come away with a new
1970-01-01 00:14:35: thing I'm thinking about.
1970-01-01 00:14:36: I feel like I lucked out like in maybe 2011 or so there was a pretty thriving synth community
1970-01-01 00:14:45: in New York that I sort of like found myself in.
1970-01-01 00:14:52: So I got super excited about the idea of making music.
1970-01-01 00:14:55: I really wanted to.
1970-01-01 00:14:56: I was already a DJ.
1970-01-01 00:14:59: I lived in Kansas before in Kansas City.
1970-01-01 00:15:01: I was part of like a rave scene there.
1970-01-01 00:15:04: So yeah, I always wanted to and then I feel like I just met some like really nice people
1970-01-01 00:15:09: that were interested in like talking about synthesizers and like I could try out different
1970-01-01 00:15:15: drum machines and figure out what I wanted and like I bought this from a friend, Okta
1970-01-01 00:15:21: Okta.
1970-01-01 00:15:24: So everything just sort of came in little bits and then being a part of a community
1970-01-01 00:15:28: of people that are all trying to kind of build their own sounds.
1970-01-01 00:15:33: It just, I don't know, it's really inspiring.
1970-01-01 00:15:38: Now I mostly just like work alone in my studio but I'm super into like how many people are
1970-01-01 00:15:45: around doing cool things.
1970-01-01 00:15:47: I don't know, I just, I feel like music production can be so intimidating that like I just always
1970-01-01 00:15:52: tell people that like however you can make stuff is fine and like you don't have to use
1970-01-01 00:15:57: Ableton and you don't have to use expensive equipment.
1970-01-01 00:16:02: So yeah, I just encourage people to like play and go for it.
1970-01-01 00:16:06: Thanks Fact for having me go against the clock.
1970-01-01 00:16:10: It's like an exciting challenge because I usually don't work in front of anyone and
1970-01-01 00:16:15: it kind of makes me like not overthink anything or it's cool to kind of see like oh maybe
1970-01-01 00:16:24: I could make a song in 10 minutes and it wouldn't be like terrible, it just wouldn't be that
1970-01-01 00:16:28: interesting or I don't know, it's a, I kind of like would like to try to do more 10 minute
1970-01-01 00:16:33: songs.
