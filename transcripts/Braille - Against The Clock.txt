1970-01-01 00:00:00: My name is Braille and I'm going against the clock with FACT TV.
1970-01-01 00:00:12: Alright, let's start with some profit.
1970-01-01 00:00:30: Alright, that should be good for now.
1970-01-01 00:00:40: And we're going to move this over here.
1970-01-01 00:00:53: Alright, we're going to run this through one of my favorite type of plug-ins.
1970-01-01 00:00:56: It's a granular sampler. It's called River Run.
1970-01-01 00:00:59: You can't get this one anymore, but you can get something similar.
1970-01-01 00:01:02: There's a lot out there.
1970-01-01 00:01:05: And we're going to open this up.
1970-01-01 00:01:09: The most important part for this sort of thing is the grain length.
1970-01-01 00:01:13: We're going to turn that bad boy way up for what we want to accomplish.
1970-01-01 00:01:17: Get the grain speed up.
1970-01-01 00:01:21: Let's see what happens here.
1970-01-01 00:01:22: So this guy allows you to control the walk of the playhead.
1970-01-01 00:01:28: So you can time it.
1970-01-01 00:01:33: Alright, yeah, that's going to be good.
1970-01-01 00:01:35: Alright, so we're going to make a new track.
1970-01-01 00:01:38: We're going to record in that guy.
1970-01-01 00:02:08: Alright, so the funny thing about this guy is it's always a little bit off when you finish recording it because of the delay in the input.
1970-01-01 00:02:20: So you usually have to move things over a little bit, I think.
1970-01-01 00:02:24: This is how we'll do it with this timing.
1970-01-01 00:02:27: Let's check it out.
1970-01-01 00:02:30: Yeah, that's good.
1970-01-01 00:02:32: That's some kicks here.
1970-01-01 00:02:35: I usually just keep these 808s loaded up.
1970-01-01 00:02:38: Some long, long dogs.
1970-01-01 00:02:42: Here we go.
1970-01-01 00:03:05: Alright, so I think that should be good.
1970-01-01 00:03:14: We're just going to quantize this bad boy because it's sloppy style.
1970-01-01 00:03:19: Quantize.
1970-01-01 00:03:21: Let's hear this back.
1970-01-01 00:03:27: And some percussion in here.
1970-01-01 00:03:31: Yeah, that's good.
1970-01-01 00:03:34: So I think the most important thing I've been learning lately is to use what's around you.
1970-01-01 00:03:39: So I've got this vase over here.
1970-01-01 00:03:41: I've got my table.
1970-01-01 00:03:42: Let's see what we can do with it.
1970-01-01 00:04:04: Alright, that should be good.
1970-01-01 00:04:24: I'm going to see if I actually got that dropping my shit all over the place because that's actually going to be a pretty cool sample.
1970-01-01 00:04:33: So we're going to save that bad boy over there.
1970-01-01 00:04:38: Now, I would usually record these separately, but 10 minutes, 10 minutes.
1970-01-01 00:04:42: Let's move this shit over here.
1970-01-01 00:04:51: Let's see what this sounds like.
1970-01-01 00:05:00: We're going to run this through some delay here.
1970-01-01 00:05:11: Alright, so it sounds kind of like crap right now, but we'll try and fix that as much as we can in 10 minutes.
1970-01-01 00:05:17: Let's give it some reverb here.
1970-01-01 00:05:19: We want it to be a big splash like that.
1970-01-01 00:05:23: But not like that.
1970-01-01 00:05:32: A little pre-delay.
1970-01-01 00:05:36: There we go.
1970-01-01 00:05:41: Yeah, alright.
1970-01-01 00:05:43: We're going to pitch these guys around at such a resonant frequency.
1970-01-01 00:05:47: I've got this chain down here that's just going to like over-compress the shit out of it.
1970-01-01 00:05:54: Turn this down a bit.
1970-01-01 00:06:01: There we go.
1970-01-01 00:06:02: So we're going to do this.
1970-01-01 00:06:09: Yeah, there we go.
1970-01-01 00:06:11: We're going to move that one down.
1970-01-01 00:06:20: Let's try this.
1970-01-01 00:06:28: Oh, cool.
1970-01-01 00:06:29: And then we'll, yeah.
1970-01-01 00:06:39: Cool.
1970-01-01 00:06:40: Alright, so we got this bad boy.
1970-01-01 00:06:45: Alright, so what we want to do is let's duplicate this out.
1970-01-01 00:06:56: We'll just do this for now.
1970-01-01 00:07:00: And we want, let's lead up to a part where it's like really sparse.
1970-01-01 00:07:08: So we'll do half of that right there.
1970-01-01 00:07:16: And then right there.
1970-01-01 00:07:20: I'm going to get some sort of stabs going on and open it up for all the drums that we just added.
1970-01-01 00:07:26: And then we'll get rid of them here.
1970-01-01 00:07:29: Except let's keep that guy.
1970-01-01 00:07:34: So lead into it and we'll have this part, the crazy part.
1970-01-01 00:07:39: Yeah.
1970-01-01 00:07:42: And pitch that down.
1970-01-01 00:07:45: To fit with the rest.
1970-01-01 00:07:47: Let's see what this sounds like here.
1970-01-01 00:08:06: Let's add some probes here.
1970-01-01 00:08:14: Alright.
1970-01-01 00:08:16: We may not keep that in, but for now, we're running out of time.
1970-01-01 00:08:19: So let's add some little bit here.
1970-01-01 00:08:48: Alright, so we'll keep that.
1970-01-01 00:08:50: We'll fuck with that in a second, but let's move this over.
1970-01-01 00:08:54: And the one thing this stab is missing is some reverb.
1970-01-01 00:08:59: So let's lead into that part.
1970-01-01 00:09:11: Oh, that's where it's the delay.
1970-01-01 00:09:23: We're going to keep it.
1970-01-01 00:09:53: Let's get some sidechain on this.
1970-01-01 00:10:17: Well, that's all we got.
1970-01-01 00:10:23: That's the most obnoxious ringtone ever.
1970-01-01 00:10:26: Against the clock.
1970-01-01 00:10:56: That's the most obnoxious ringtone ever.
