1970-01-01 00:00:00: Hi, this is Iconica and this is me against the cock.
1970-01-01 00:00:13: I said cock.
1970-01-01 00:00:14: Yeah you said cock.
1970-01-01 00:00:15: This is Iconica and I'm going against the clock.
1970-01-01 00:02:30: Sounding very silly already.
1970-01-01 00:07:29: I could use it as a layer.
1970-01-01 00:09:58: Yeah, I guess that'll allâ€¦
1970-01-01 00:10:23: Yeah, I started using a little fatty, had like a just a arpeggio going and ended up
1970-01-01 00:10:37: doing this.
1970-01-01 00:10:38: But yeah, I don't know, I was just trying to make some kind of rhythm to get started
1970-01-01 00:10:44: with.
1970-01-01 00:10:48: And I think I just modulated it using just using some delay on the lexicon and the distortion
1970-01-01 00:10:57: was running.
1970-01-01 00:11:00: But I was just playing around with the delay and the cutoff and I think the modulator added
1970-01-01 00:11:07: a layer of slightly higher arpeggios.
1970-01-01 00:11:12: Yeah, and then added a bassline.
1970-01-01 00:11:21: Bassline's just a mini moog plug-in.
1970-01-01 00:11:23: Just a really simple free note bassline.
1970-01-01 00:11:32: And then the drums are all in the machine or the machina.
1970-01-01 00:11:39: I've used samples from my own 707 and Casio RZ-1.
1970-01-01 00:11:46: 707 is running in group A. Just really simple.
1970-01-01 00:11:53: Hang on a minute.
1970-01-01 00:11:56: There we go.
1970-01-01 00:11:58: Just the four bar loop.
1970-01-01 00:12:02: No time to do any fills.
1970-01-01 00:12:04: And then the Casio's just playing this pattern.
1970-01-01 00:12:13: The hi-hats, I just put a flanger on there and a beat delay.
1970-01-01 00:12:18: That's all in within the machina.
