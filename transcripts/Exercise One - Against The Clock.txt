1970-01-01 00:00:00: Hello, first we're Exercise 1.
1970-01-01 00:00:15: We play the against the clock for Fact TV.
1970-01-01 00:00:20: First we show you quickly how our little setup works and how we start a track basically.
1970-01-01 00:00:26: We have different kind of synthesizers, drum machines and sequences.
1970-01-01 00:00:32: And actually we start mostly with a little melody.
1970-01-01 00:00:37: Like something like this.
1970-01-01 00:00:39: We have like two prepared samples.
1970-01-01 00:00:41: One is like from an interview with Jimmy Chamush.
1970-01-01 00:00:47: Which is the intro sample of our new album.
1970-01-01 00:00:51: Exactly.
1970-01-01 00:00:52: We are not going to try to create the same track.
1970-01-01 00:00:55: We just wanted to use it because we're thinking about maybe using something like this for
1970-01-01 00:00:58: the intro of our live set.
1970-01-01 00:00:59: So we thought that's a good sample to start this off.
1970-01-01 00:01:02: Does we like just some talking at the beginning of our live shows?
1970-01-01 00:01:06: It sits well.
1970-01-01 00:01:07: And that's in like the Octatrack sampler.
1970-01-01 00:01:10: And then there's another one.
1970-01-01 00:01:11: What we process, it's an old sample from us.
1970-01-01 00:01:14: What we process with Ableton long time ago.
1970-01-01 00:01:17: What we thought fits quite well in this track.
1970-01-01 00:01:19: Which is like a long developing pad sound.
1970-01-01 00:01:31: And this is in this machine.
1970-01-01 00:01:32: Then we have our drum machine with patterns already.
1970-01-01 00:01:35: What we wrote for our live set.
1970-01-01 00:01:37: And we have the 101 here where I can immediately, like I want on the fly, building sequences
1970-01-01 00:01:44: which are triggered by the 4analog.
1970-01-01 00:01:47: Let's just start.
1970-01-01 00:01:48: Let's do it.
1970-01-01 00:01:49: We hit here and then we go through the different instruments and build it all up.
1970-01-01 00:01:51: And then let's see if we have time for an arrangement.
1970-01-01 00:01:53: Shall I start?
1970-01-01 00:01:55: Yes, you can start.
1970-01-01 00:01:57: And this little melody I record now in the machine.
1970-01-01 00:02:17: Now I have it in the box.
1970-01-01 00:02:22: Next I bring the sample here what I showed you before from the interview with Jimmy Chamuch.
1970-01-01 00:02:34: And we have here little effects on the mixer like a reverb.
1970-01-01 00:02:39: And then typical next step is if we have something running I check one of these things.
1970-01-01 00:02:47: Which I trigger through this sequencer.
1970-01-01 00:02:56: Or what?
1970-01-01 00:02:58: Which note do you use?
1970-01-01 00:03:00: Like I have ice and sea.
1970-01-01 00:03:05: Ok, so then I will try out.
1970-01-01 00:03:09: And you see I am here and it does something.
1970-01-01 00:03:12: I am just going to go through some favorite things.
1970-01-01 00:03:16: We always have arrangements and we have our favorites in the machine.
1970-01-01 00:03:19: Or old program stuff.
1970-01-01 00:03:21: And we are going to do something a bit more rhythmic.
1970-01-01 00:03:25: But that's not it.
1970-01-01 00:03:27: I think I like this one.
1970-01-01 00:03:35: First little sequence on site.
1970-01-01 00:03:37: Yes, it's going to be up to the end.
1970-01-01 00:03:39: But we just got needed for now.
1970-01-01 00:03:41: We don't have time for that.
1970-01-01 00:03:43: We can tweak it later to make it fit perfectly.
1970-01-01 00:03:47: But for now it's just so...
1970-01-01 00:03:49: And I bring now like a bit more running sequence with the 101.
1970-01-01 00:03:56: We just said we are kind of on sequence.
1970-01-01 00:03:59: And we are going to do some kind of a sequence.
1970-01-01 00:04:02: We just said we are kind of on sea and on ice.
1970-01-01 00:04:26: I am trying to record this.
1970-01-01 00:04:28: Quickly so we have something inside.
1970-01-01 00:04:30: Just very basic.
1970-01-01 00:04:43: See what ended up.
1970-01-01 00:04:50: And then I can just check how long it is.
1970-01-01 00:04:54: This one.
1970-01-01 00:04:56: Make it a bit shorter.
1970-01-01 00:05:00: And then we have another note.
1970-01-01 00:05:30: Check the notes.
1970-01-01 00:05:32: Maybe...
1970-01-01 00:05:38: It's enough.
1970-01-01 00:05:48: Take a little hop inside here.
1970-01-01 00:05:55: And then during the north high edge.
1970-01-01 00:06:00: I always have also some standard patterns on here.
1970-01-01 00:06:03: This is from the live set.
1970-01-01 00:06:05: And I also have another high edge which I think could be nice.
1970-01-01 00:06:07: I have always a later point in the array to just have the hand.
1970-01-01 00:06:10: Here it is.
1970-01-01 00:06:12: Do you want to bring somebody later after the range?
1970-01-01 00:06:15: It's good to extend with some ammunition for like a point in the array to later receive.
1970-01-01 00:06:20: It's always not bad to have.
1970-01-01 00:06:22: But like, yeah, maybe switch to a couple of sounds.
1970-01-01 00:06:25: Just to check.
1970-01-01 00:06:26: Take a different one would probably be better.
1970-01-01 00:06:30: Now that one will be ready kind of now.
1970-01-01 00:06:32: That's not bad.
1970-01-01 00:06:38: Now I can get the back.
1970-01-01 00:06:42: So I just say that means it's made up.
1970-01-01 00:06:54: Okay, then.
1970-01-01 00:06:56: Find something cool.
1970-01-01 00:06:59: This is another open channel.
1970-01-01 00:07:01: Which I know the media from this channel goes to the group.
1970-01-01 00:07:04: And same thing, no one's seen yet.
1970-01-01 00:07:07: No one is in the scene.
1970-01-01 00:07:09: So I jump to a closed theme.
1970-01-01 00:07:14: Do you have a set or a noise?
1970-01-01 00:07:19: Play or play?
1970-01-01 00:07:29: I think it's a little bit.
1970-01-01 00:07:31: One thing is that any sound is maybe a little bit too heavy.
1970-01-01 00:07:35: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
1970-01-01 00:07:42: Ten, ten, ten, ten.
1970-01-01 00:07:48: Very good.
1970-01-01 00:07:54: I can, for example, always.
1970-01-01 00:07:59: Record in the sampler whatever we are doing here.
1970-01-01 00:08:02: And I have it also inside the machine.
1970-01-01 00:08:06: Which brings us always to very nice results.
1970-01-01 00:08:10: Now we hear the movie double.
1970-01-01 00:08:15: And this happens to have this.
1970-01-01 00:08:18: Checking out again.
1970-01-01 00:08:20: Another first data.
1970-01-01 00:08:29: Come on in.
1970-01-01 00:08:31: It's a car.
1970-01-01 00:08:37: One fun thing with this machine is sometimes you use the
1970-01-01 00:08:39: PGA data.
1970-01-01 00:08:41: So I'll just try that one out last and then we'll just try to
1970-01-01 00:08:43: make a quick arrangement.
1970-01-01 00:08:45: And we should go set it on the sound we have.
1970-01-01 00:08:50: And then we can do some.
1970-01-01 00:08:53: Very good.
1970-01-01 00:09:03: OK.
1970-01-01 00:09:05: Should we restart?
1970-01-01 00:09:07: OK, so now we have a whole bunch of elements.
1970-01-01 00:09:09: And then.
1970-01-01 00:09:11: Now we played it right, exactly.
1970-01-01 00:09:13: And then let's see how we want to put it all together.
1970-01-01 00:09:17: OK, I have to take that one out.
1970-01-01 00:09:19: And then we have all from the drums.
1970-01-01 00:09:21: We have everything like we can mute the kick, the snares,
1970-01-01 00:09:23: the heights, everything directly on the mixer.
1970-01-01 00:09:25: On the fly.
1970-01-01 00:09:27: OK, let's start.
1970-01-01 00:09:29: The melodies I recorded already.
1970-01-01 00:09:31: Just two minutes.
1970-01-01 00:09:33: Perfect.
1970-01-01 00:09:35: Quick arrangement.
1970-01-01 00:09:49: And then we have the drums.
1970-01-01 00:09:51: And then we have the snares.
1970-01-01 00:09:53: And then we have the snares.
1970-01-01 00:09:55: And then we have the snares.
1970-01-01 00:09:57: And then we have the snares.

1970-01-01 00:11:53: And then we have the snares.
1970-01-01 00:11:55: And then we have the snares.
1970-01-01 00:11:59: That's it!
1970-01-01 00:12:03: I didn't even make it to the break.
1970-01-01 00:12:05: I didn't even make it to the break.
1970-01-01 00:12:13: I'm going to be a little bit of a
1970-01-01 00:12:15: little bit of a
1970-01-01 00:12:18: little bit of a
1970-01-01 00:12:21: little bit of a
1970-01-01 00:12:24: little bit of a
1970-01-01 00:12:27: little bit of a
1970-01-01 00:12:30: little bit of a
1970-01-01 00:12:33: little bit of a
1970-01-01 00:12:36: little bit of a
1970-01-01 00:12:39: little bit of a
1970-01-01 00:12:42: little bit of a
