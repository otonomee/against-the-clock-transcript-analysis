1970-01-01 00:00:00: Hi I'm Tom De Mac, I'm going against the clock for FackTV sitting in the chair where I spend
1970-01-01 00:00:13: a good three quarters of my life in.
1970-01-01 00:00:15: I hope you enjoy, cheers.
1970-01-01 00:00:17: Okay and we're off to the races.
1970-01-01 00:00:21: So I've got a pre-prepared kick drum.
1970-01-01 00:00:25: That's nice and fat bruv.
1970-01-01 00:00:29: And then I've just got a little drum rack here, which I'm just going to have a little jam.
1970-01-01 00:00:54: And then layer up some analogue drums from the drum machine.
1970-01-01 00:01:24: So it's fixed length on.
1970-01-01 00:01:55: I'm going to fold that up and start that again.
1970-01-01 00:01:58: And then some sort of bass line.
1970-01-01 00:02:28: Sorry.
1970-01-01 00:02:58: That'll do.
1970-01-01 00:03:03: Just some generic as hell bass line.
1970-01-01 00:03:26: What can we do next?
1970-01-01 00:03:30: Some monopoly.
1970-01-01 00:03:34: Let's go through these.
1970-01-01 00:03:48: Let's try and record something from there.
1970-01-01 00:04:26: Five minutes.
1970-01-01 00:04:46: That sounds terrible.
1970-01-01 00:04:54: But anyway.
1970-01-01 00:04:56: Really bad.
1970-01-01 00:05:02: Maybe have a couple of those coming out.
1970-01-01 00:05:23: Just going to have one of those coming in because it's really bad.
1970-01-01 00:05:31: Maybe add a little vocal of some kind.
1970-01-01 00:05:35: Obviously I've got one in a folder ready.
1970-01-01 00:05:38: I'm going to drag that into the granulator.
1970-01-01 00:05:41: And then run that through some of these bad boys.
1970-01-01 00:05:59: You're going to get all my little huffs and puffs on there and little weird sounds that I make when I'm concentrating.
1970-01-01 00:06:06: Which is cool.
1970-01-01 00:06:08: Stuff like that.
1970-01-01 00:06:27: I like to mix ethereal vocals with acid lines to make sure no DJs can play it.
1970-01-01 00:06:34: That's kind of my standard fare.
1970-01-01 00:07:27: How many minutes?
1970-01-01 00:07:55: Two minutes.
1970-01-01 00:08:12: What I'll do is try and record a little jam.
1970-01-01 00:09:12: Okay.
1970-01-01 00:09:34: Okay.
1970-01-01 00:10:01: Okay.
1970-01-01 00:10:21: That'll do.
1970-01-01 00:10:37: As you can see I'm a bit of a gear head.
1970-01-01 00:10:39: I spend most of my time looking on eBay for equipment and stuff.
1970-01-01 00:10:42: So I was just trying to get a bit of that into recording this thing for ten minutes.
1970-01-01 00:10:47: Generally ten minutes is alright.
1970-01-01 00:10:48: Only ten minutes is alright.
1970-01-01 00:10:49: That's the fun bit of making music.
1970-01-01 00:10:50: So even though I've come up with something pretty gassy and maybe not necessarily something I do,
1970-01-01 00:10:55: I just wanted to have a little bit of a jam.
1970-01-01 00:10:57: But after the ten minutes in general life is usually when the problems occur and I can never finish any music anyway.
1970-01-01 00:11:04: So just running it through.
1970-01-01 00:11:08: Just some drums in a drum rack that I just had a little bit of jam on.
1970-01-01 00:11:13: All in the name of fun.
1970-01-01 00:11:18: And then I just got a simple bass line on this MS-20.
1970-01-01 00:11:22: That's not the MS-20, that's actually the Vimona which is cool.
1970-01-01 00:11:26: So it's just a lovely analogue drum machine.
1970-01-01 00:11:29: So I just overlaid some drums on that.
1970-01-01 00:11:31: Usually with my music if anyone's familiar with it they'll find that there's quite a lot of overlaying and unnecessary shit in there.
1970-01-01 00:11:37: So I can go without doing the ten minute thing without some unnecessary shit.
1970-01-01 00:11:41: So there we go.
1970-01-01 00:11:42: This is the bass line just on the MS-20.
1970-01-01 00:11:45: Nice and simple.
1970-01-01 00:11:47: And then I was probably using the Monopoly for what is least good.
1970-01-01 00:11:51: Just a simple arpeggio and pretty basic stuff really just so I could have something else to jam on really when I was playing.
1970-01-01 00:12:12: .
