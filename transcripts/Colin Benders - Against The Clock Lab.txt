1970-01-01 00:00:00: Hi, I'm Colin Benders and I'm going against the clock. Super, super terrified for this
1970-01-01 00:00:14: stuff. Right, oh, we're going. Alright, so let's see. I'm gonna need a clock anyway.
1970-01-01 00:00:26: Let's see.
1970-01-01 00:00:56: Alright.
1970-01-01 00:02:26: Oh, here we go.
1970-01-01 00:09:56: That was scary. I had no clue what to expect actually. I was just scared shitless. So I
1970-01-01 00:10:20: think all this was just one big adrenaline rush doing all the patching, but holy shit.
1970-01-01 00:10:25: Cool, yeah. Nice. Well, yeah, this is actually the only instrument I'm playing with these
1970-01-01 00:10:45: days. I used to work with all kinds of stuff. I started off producing in Logic and such,
1970-01-01 00:10:49: but I'm way too neurotic to work with computers anymore. There's too many variables and options
1970-01-01 00:10:55: and I just end up shutting down and browsing Reddit. And so I usually, this instrument has a
1970-01-01 00:11:03: lot more focus for me. And yeah, I've been playing with this for about six, seven years now and for
1970-01-01 00:11:10: the first four years I really had no clue what I was doing. But now it's kind of starting to make
1970-01-01 00:11:17: sense for me. So I'm pretty happy with this. Well, I always like a challenge. That's
1970-01-01 00:11:41: for sure. And it was, I really like improvising with instruments, especially with this instrument.
1970-01-01 00:11:48: And against the clock, yeah, it's a hell of a challenge. I mean, 10 minutes, it flies by.
1970-01-01 00:11:54: And yeah, I wasn't really sure how much of this I could prepare. So actually outside of just
1970-01-01 00:12:03: patching the outputs of a couple of things, most of this patch was blank when I started it. And
1970-01-01 00:12:09: well, yeah, I at first, right before we started, I had this idea of like, all right, I'm gonna
1970-01-01 00:12:15: build a track and somewhat gonna go like this. And then the moment the clock started, it was
1970-01-01 00:12:20: just kind of a blank out. I was like, all right, well, let me just try and start here. But yeah,
1970-01-01 00:12:27: no, I was very curious what the experience would have been like. And my God, it was terrifying.
1970-01-01 00:12:38: Cool. Nice. Thanks.
