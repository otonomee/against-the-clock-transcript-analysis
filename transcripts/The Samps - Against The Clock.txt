1970-01-01 00:00:00: I'm Harland. I'm Cole M. Jinn. We're going against the clock for Sam's TV. Well, Jason
1970-01-01 00:00:12: couldn't be with us today, so he just sent us some samples and gave us some
1970-01-01 00:00:18: material to play around with. It's not like we always use samples, but oftentimes
1970-01-01 00:00:23: that's what we do. So yeah, we've got that and then we have like tons of drum
1970-01-01 00:00:28: sounds and then it's just kind of doing our same process of starting with
1970-01-01 00:00:34: the sample, chopping it up, and then I just start hearing synth parts. I mean we
1970-01-01 00:00:40: don't really have a process that we normally work with. It's kind of any old
1970-01-01 00:00:44: way. All of us do everything and so we might be making a beat, we might be
1970-01-01 00:00:50: making a melody, we might be structuring a song. It's never a set process.
1970-01-01 00:01:28: So, stand up, like this, up and out.
1970-01-01 00:01:36: If you really don't know, the drum is far so loud.
1970-01-01 00:01:44: Downhill in song, downhill, downhill in song. All of your soul on the rocket
1970-01-01 00:02:59: down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down
1970-01-01 00:03:29: Keep, keep us alone
1970-01-01 00:03:45: Keep, keep, keep us alone
1970-01-01 00:04:29: That's what I said.
1970-01-01 00:04:33: This is one of the most advanced drum beats I've ever made.
1970-01-01 00:04:40: Now we're going to see it actually.
1970-01-01 00:04:42: Okay.
1970-01-01 00:04:46: Oh, that's it.
1970-01-01 00:04:48: That's all good.
1970-01-01 00:04:55: There we go.
1970-01-01 00:04:57: I don't think I've ever heard a drum beat like this before.
1970-01-01 00:05:00: Alright, let's try it.
1970-01-01 00:05:06: Believe that's correct.
1970-01-01 00:05:08: Believe it.
1970-01-01 00:05:13: Here.
1970-01-01 00:05:17: What does that sound like?
1970-01-01 00:05:23: Put it all together and...
1970-01-01 00:05:42: Yeah.
1970-01-01 00:06:12: Yeah.
1970-01-01 00:06:42: Yeah.
1970-01-01 00:07:12: Yeah.
1970-01-01 00:07:42: Alright, that's pretty good.
1970-01-01 00:07:44: Do you want something from me, partner?
1970-01-01 00:07:46: Give me a second, I'm going to...
1970-01-01 00:07:48: Let's hear it one more time.
1970-01-01 00:08:12: Yeah.
1970-01-01 00:08:42: Alright.
1970-01-01 00:08:44: Let's hear it.
1970-01-01 00:08:46: Let's see.
1970-01-01 00:08:48: Let's see what we can see.
1970-01-01 00:08:50: Play it for me.
1970-01-01 00:08:52: Alright.
1970-01-01 00:08:54: Okay.
1970-01-01 00:08:56: Here.
1970-01-01 00:08:58: Here.
1970-01-01 00:09:00: Here.
1970-01-01 00:09:02: Here.
1970-01-01 00:09:04: Here.
1970-01-01 00:09:06: Here.
1970-01-01 00:09:08: Here.
1970-01-01 00:09:11: That's what we call a sad boy blanket.
1970-01-01 00:09:15: We're going to see what you're doing with that.
1970-01-01 00:09:17: Yeah, I think that's good.
1970-01-01 00:09:19: So, high note on the downbeat.
1970-01-01 00:09:22: Let's try it.
1970-01-01 00:09:27: Oh.
1970-01-01 00:09:40: Yeah.
1970-01-01 00:09:42: Yeah.
1970-01-01 00:09:44: Yeah.
1970-01-01 00:09:46: Yeah.
1970-01-01 00:09:48: Yeah.
1970-01-01 00:09:50: Yeah.
1970-01-01 00:09:52: Yeah.
1970-01-01 00:09:54: Yeah.
1970-01-01 00:09:56: Yeah.
1970-01-01 00:09:58: Yeah.
1970-01-01 00:10:00: Yeah.
1970-01-01 00:10:02: Yeah.
1970-01-01 00:10:04: Yeah.
1970-01-01 00:10:06: Yeah.
1970-01-01 00:10:08: Yeah.
1970-01-01 00:10:10: Yeah.
1970-01-01 00:10:12: Yeah.
1970-01-01 00:10:14: Yeah.
1970-01-01 00:10:16: Yeah.
1970-01-01 00:10:26: Yeah.
1970-01-01 00:10:28: Yeah.
1970-01-01 00:10:30: Yeah.
1970-01-01 00:10:32: Yeah.
1970-01-01 00:10:34: Yeah.
1970-01-01 00:10:36: I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I
1970-01-01 00:11:06: think it went really good I think you know we just wanted to give a little
1970-01-01 00:11:21: glimpse into our process and how we go about editing and processing the audio
1970-01-01 00:11:27: that we're working with. I don't really get nervous anymore with this kind of
1970-01-01 00:11:32: stuff because like I play in a bunch of bands but it is a thing with the Sam's
1970-01-01 00:11:36: is that we don't usually perform live and so this is almost like performing
1970-01-01 00:11:42: live just because it's like you have ten minutes to make this thing. Usually our
1970-01-01 00:11:46: process involves a lot of detail work which takes a lot longer but things will
1970-01-01 00:11:52: begin with a moment of drunken inspiration like what might have
1970-01-01 00:11:56: happened right now. In this case I was chopping up the sample, Harley played
1970-01-01 00:12:00: some synth parts, sent them to me, he did some drums, I added it in and just kind of
1970-01-01 00:12:07: added up. So this is like taking our usual process and just like shrinking it
1970-01-01 00:12:13: down which is kind of that is a little bit like yeah it was a little difficult.
1970-01-01 00:12:20: I feel like we know what we're doing at this point so I think it was it was
1970-01-01 00:12:23: pretty simple and straightforward and I like the songs that Jason sent us so I
1970-01-01 00:12:28: think it was pretty easy to grab some stuff from there and have fun.
