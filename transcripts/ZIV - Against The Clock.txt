1970-01-01 00:11:03: It was a bit stressful to make a beat like in 10 minutes with the clock
1970-01-01 00:11:08: But it was really fun as well
1970-01-01 00:11:11: I had a great time
1970-01-01 00:11:13: I think this like minor 7, the chord
1970-01-01 00:11:16: It's like really vibey, it's really dreamy
1970-01-01 00:11:19: I usually use it when I just want to make it fast and easy
1970-01-01 00:11:23: I just used my voice as an instrument basically
1970-01-01 00:11:27: I didn't think about it as a singer

1970-01-01 00:11:34: I just wanna hear you touch
1970-01-01 00:11:37: I just thought to myself like what would I play on the keys
1970-01-01 00:11:41: If I was a piano, so
1970-01-01 00:11:44: I really like it, I think I'll listen to it before I fall asleep tonight
1970-01-01 00:11:49: Yeah
1970-01-01 00:11:50: And even though it was my 10 minute speech, I think I still got it
