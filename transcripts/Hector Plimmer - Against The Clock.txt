1970-01-01 00:10:38: Not feeling the melody at the end, but there's always something you can take out of it and
1970-01-01 00:10:43: mess around, you know.
1970-01-01 00:10:44: It kind of varies, I just sit down and see what, sometimes it just comes out making a
1970-01-01 00:10:48: weird noise, like pitching stuff up and down.
1970-01-01 00:10:52: Sometimes I just have a drum beat in my head and go with that and then kind of build up
1970-01-01 00:10:55: on it, or sometimes samples and stuff like that.
