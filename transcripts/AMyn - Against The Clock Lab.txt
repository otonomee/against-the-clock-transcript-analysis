1970-01-01 00:10:29: Applause.
1970-01-01 00:10:32: Applause.
1970-01-01 00:10:35: How long did you think you had left?
1970-01-01 00:10:38: Five.
1970-01-01 00:10:41: I was going to like...
1970-01-01 00:10:44: How do you think you hit like?
1970-01-01 00:10:47: I was going to hit like ten.
1970-01-01 00:10:50: But I'm pretty happy with it.
1970-01-01 00:10:53: It sounded really good.
1970-01-01 00:10:56: It sounded very chill.
1970-01-01 00:10:59: It seemed like R&B.
1970-01-01 00:11:02: Hip-hopish.
1970-01-01 00:11:05: Were there things that you prepared in advance?
1970-01-01 00:11:08: Yeah, I knew a few of the chords that kind of worked.
1970-01-01 00:11:11: With that patch and with that sound.
1970-01-01 00:11:14: I didn't know what I was going for.
1970-01-01 00:11:17: I didn't know the bass or the beats.
1970-01-01 00:11:20: I wasn't sure about those.
1970-01-01 00:11:23: But I knew a little bit of the melody that kind of worked.
1970-01-01 00:11:26: That's the only thing I sort of prepared.
1970-01-01 00:11:29: For the rest it was just spontaneous.
1970-01-01 00:11:32: Are these your favorite?
1970-01-01 00:11:35: Yeah, this is basically my studio.
1970-01-01 00:11:38: Is it?
1970-01-01 00:11:41: I play this kind of stuff as a live set.
1970-01-01 00:11:44: Then I use mainly what I use to make those tracks.
1970-01-01 00:11:47: This is basically the sound that I developed.
1970-01-01 00:11:50: It's the Prophet and the Moog as a base.
1970-01-01 00:11:53: I think together they really work well.
1970-01-01 00:11:56: If you had your five minutes,
1970-01-01 00:11:59: what would you add onto the track?
1970-01-01 00:12:02: What would you add?
1970-01-01 00:12:05: I think I would add a little bit of a mix.
1970-01-01 00:12:08: If you had your five minutes, what would you add onto the track?
1970-01-01 00:12:11: What was your next process of doing it?
1970-01-01 00:12:14: I think more arrangements.
1970-01-01 00:12:17: I was working at starting with an intro and then dropping the beat and the bass.
1970-01-01 00:12:20: It has more of a story.
1970-01-01 00:12:23: I have two main melody parts.
1970-01-01 00:12:26: I wanted to create more of a story.
1970-01-01 00:12:29: Now it's still just there.
1970-01-01 00:12:32: I might finish it for a few minutes.
1970-01-01 00:12:35: I'm not just there, but I might finish it for later.
