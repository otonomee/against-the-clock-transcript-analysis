1970-01-01 00:00:00: Hi, I'm MJ Cole, you're in my studio and I'm going against the clock with fact.
1970-01-01 00:00:10: Go!
1970-01-01 00:10:00: Yeah, it was cool.
1970-01-01 00:10:27: Obviously it went very, very quickly.
1970-01-01 00:10:29: I thought it was going to be about twice as long.
1970-01-01 00:10:32: But yeah, it felt cool.
1970-01-01 00:10:33: It's always nice to have a bit of pressure.
1970-01-01 00:10:35: I put quite a lot of the stuff I do songwriting as well, so it might start at the piano before
1970-01-01 00:10:39: it really goes to the computer and there'll be songwriting going on here.
1970-01-01 00:10:45: I come from piano as well, so really I'm a player, so I really need to have a keyboard
1970-01-01 00:10:50: around to play.
1970-01-01 00:10:51: You see I play my drums in and stuff like that.
1970-01-01 00:10:54: I never really put any programming thing on the screen.
1970-01-01 00:10:57: So I'm not like one of those guys who can make tunes on airplanes and stuff like that.
1970-01-01 00:11:02: I need to have a keyboard here.
1970-01-01 00:11:04: And if I have a piano on the roads as well, they're my friends, so it kind of helps.
