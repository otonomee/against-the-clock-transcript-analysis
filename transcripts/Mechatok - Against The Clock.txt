1970-01-01 00:10:00: Add the clock and time out.
1970-01-01 00:10:21: So first I edit a little bit of atmosphere from FACT TV.
1970-01-01 00:10:26: The KORG M1, which I really love.
1970-01-01 00:10:33: And then quickly added those chords.
1970-01-01 00:10:46: Then I took the key from those chords to make a bass with it.
1970-01-01 00:10:54: And a more deeper bass from Razor.
1970-01-01 00:11:09: And added a snap.
1970-01-01 00:11:13: That's pretty much it.
1970-01-01 00:11:17: Very simple.
1970-01-01 00:11:18: 10 minutes.
1970-01-01 00:11:19: Oh yeah, that was the lead as well.
1970-01-01 00:11:22: I kind of tried to make a lead sound, but then got a bit confused.
1970-01-01 00:11:31: So ended up making this sort of wooden weird sound.
1970-01-01 00:11:41: So yes, this is how it sounds.
