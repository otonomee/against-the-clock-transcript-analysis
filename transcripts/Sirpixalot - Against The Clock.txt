1970-01-01 00:00:14: Just start off with a one kick.
1970-01-01 00:00:15: Alright.
1970-01-01 00:00:16: Get a little pattern going there.
1970-01-01 00:02:11: There we go, that's what we want.
1970-01-01 00:05:02: Alright, let's just do that.
1970-01-01 00:05:21: That's where I end up mapping everything out.
1970-01-01 00:05:43: Yeah, we'll do that.

1970-01-01 00:08:35: Right.
1970-01-01 00:08:37: Hey.
1970-01-01 00:08:39: Hey.
1970-01-01 00:08:41: Run it up and down.
1970-01-01 00:08:43: How long left?
1970-01-01 00:08:59: One minute.
1970-01-01 00:09:03: One minute.
1970-01-01 00:09:13: One minute.
1970-01-01 00:09:19: Blood, come on.
1970-01-01 00:09:23: Emission lines.
1970-01-01 00:09:29: Repeat, pressure up.
1970-01-01 00:09:33: Yeah, that's what we want.
1970-01-01 00:09:35: Alright.
1970-01-01 00:09:49: Alright, let's try that.
1970-01-01 00:09:53: 20 seconds there.
1970-01-01 00:09:59: Alright.
1970-01-01 00:10:03: Alright.
1970-01-01 00:10:11: Cool.
1970-01-01 00:10:17: Okay, pressure up.
1970-01-01 00:10:29: How long left?
1970-01-01 00:10:35: Stress, pressure, everything.
1970-01-01 00:10:37: But yeah, I've had a bit of practice
1970-01-01 00:10:39: because I thought, you know, let me just have a little go in there.
1970-01-01 00:10:42: But it is really, yeah, because sometimes I'll make beats
1970-01-01 00:10:45: and it'll take me like, there was one beat that took me, like in Brazil,
1970-01-01 00:10:48: that took me like a year because I put it down and came back to it.
1970-01-01 00:10:51: But it's kind of good in a way, when you're under pressure,
1970-01-01 00:10:54: it just like forces you to do something quick anyway
1970-01-01 00:10:56: and then you might have done something you might have not done before.
1970-01-01 00:10:58: So yeah, I've always used Reason 5.
1970-01-01 00:11:00: I haven't updated, I probably should, but yeah, just Reason 5
1970-01-01 00:11:03: and then sometimes Ableton just to get like,
1970-01-01 00:11:05: if I want to try and get a louder master or something like that.
1970-01-01 00:11:08: It's just Reason 5, it's my MIDI keyboard.
1970-01-01 00:11:10: You know, I use certain samples sometimes, you know,
1970-01-01 00:11:13: like my own sounds that I've built, stuff like that.
1970-01-01 00:11:15: Pretty much that's it, man. Laptop, studio monitors, keyboard.
1970-01-01 00:11:26: Thanks for watching.
