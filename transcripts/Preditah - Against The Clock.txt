1970-01-01 00:00:00: Yo, this is Predator. This is my against the clock for Facts magazine. But the most important
1970-01-01 00:00:10: thing for us is my glasses because I can't see. Cool.
1970-01-01 00:01:10: What?
1970-01-01 00:01:12: What?

1970-01-01 00:08:47: a
1970-01-01 00:08:49: D
1970-01-01 00:08:51: A

1970-01-01 00:09:11: D
1970-01-01 00:09:13: I
1970-01-01 00:09:43: You
1970-01-01 00:10:05: But I did predator I did
1970-01-01 00:10:13: I
1970-01-01 00:10:26: Could change something I probably change
1970-01-01 00:10:29: the swing of it
1970-01-01 00:10:31: That's about it. Part from that is fine. If I make a certain from scratch just like messing experimenting and it will take
1970-01-01 00:10:38: Not to know depends on how good idea is might take a day might take an hour
1970-01-01 00:10:42: Depends if it's right that I'm working on that I'm trying to finish you might take weeks to get sour
1970-01-01 00:10:47: Oh, I don't really test music when I'm DJing because that's more of a funnel
1970-01-01 00:10:51: Like I wouldn't risk it no matter how good the tune is
1970-01-01 00:10:54: I think the gene is but I just tested painting the car because you get to get different visuals obviously
1970-01-01 00:11:00: But that's about it really I might show my friends if it's finished
1970-01-01 00:11:03: I'm a perfectionist so it has to sound like before I show anyone I'm at the moment
1970-01-01 00:11:06: I'm working within obviously logic like in house because I'm always on the move
1970-01-01 00:11:10: So my laptop, but if I'm here at the moment
1970-01-01 00:11:13: It's maybe the movie that I'm using just to get more warmer bass sounds. That's right
1970-01-01 00:11:17: Really I'll be using hardware for the past four or five years. So I think hardware you get better sound out of there
1970-01-01 00:11:23: There's still some decent software stuff that I've got obviously, but
1970-01-01 00:11:27: Hardware is better. I think and the equipment that I've got I've got everything over the years
1970-01-01 00:11:31: The latest thing I've got really is probably
1970-01-01 00:11:34: the focal monitors and
1970-01-01 00:11:37: Mami but I've had
1970-01-01 00:11:39: I've discovered over the years I use you a D for my sound card a lot of native instruments
1970-01-01 00:11:45: Equipment especially like software wise I've got to try it in as well
1970-01-01 00:11:50: Got a rolling for like all my roads and stuff like that, but there's nothing spectacular
1970-01-01 00:11:54: It's just all stuff that I've gathered just to add to my sound really, but this is like a pre
1970-01-01 00:11:59: Used
1970-01-01 00:12:01: Vocal sample that I've got of a certain artist so I've just sliced up before and I've just made any melody out of it really
1970-01-01 00:12:10: John kit wise again. I've got all my sounds in different folders. I might use a lot of native instruments like
1970-01-01 00:12:18: Sounds as well because they've got decent sounds but again all my drum sounds are from sample packs or
1970-01-01 00:12:25: Productions that I've done over the years and just resampled
1970-01-01 00:12:29: I've even got try and jump sounds that I've had to reprogram in to machine to use
1970-01-01 00:12:34: Just that I've got an individual sound at the moment as well
1970-01-01 00:12:38: I'm using a lot of Roland cloud and software because this is all basically all the hardware stuff as
1970-01-01 00:12:43: Now a software so I would pay monthly for all by outright
1970-01-01 00:12:47: But you get to use all of their cool hardware sounds and to be fair. It's not far off
1970-01-01 00:12:52: The hardware so it's good enough. Yeah, so I've got a lot of presets to us
1970-01-01 00:12:56: I've saved over the years again almost and what I do is I'll probably just use my typical default sounds and then I'll change them
1970-01-01 00:13:03: depending on obviously what tune is and who I'm working with and you know the artist or
1970-01-01 00:13:08: The feeling I'm going for but I like to I like to start from scratch and just use
1970-01-01 00:13:12: Something I used before just to get a new inspiration. So
1970-01-01 00:13:16: Yeah, that's why I tend to use I've been making music from
1970-01-01 00:13:21: Since 13 or 14 years old
1970-01-01 00:13:23: So I love paying music in church, I'm a bassist
1970-01-01 00:13:26: Six string bass dead don't know I'm a bassist
1970-01-01 00:13:29: That's where it all started on the bass guitar
1970-01-01 00:13:30: And then I eventually
1970-01-01 00:13:31: Learn how to use logic and key base and stuff like that when I was a kid
1970-01-01 00:13:36: I'm self-taught so if I know is off the head top or me figuring out over the years
1970-01-01 00:13:42: Or even just a friend coming everyone saying on you do know you can you do that quicker?
1970-01-01 00:13:47: So you just learn as you go really then I've been DJing for the past 10 to 12 years
1970-01-01 00:13:52: So it's all happened spontaneously and naturally really. Yeah, first piece of advice is
1970-01-01 00:13:58: Learn an instrument. I know that sounds really old and not cool
1970-01-01 00:14:01: but if you know how to play an instrument then you'll figure out if enough if you know your skills and chords and keys and
1970-01-01 00:14:08: Yeah stuff like that. It's all geeky, but I'm old school. You have to know your theory all I've done to make this
1970-01-01 00:14:15: really random track is
1970-01-01 00:14:18: just
1970-01-01 00:14:19: playing a chord
1970-01-01 00:14:22: and pitch it down
1970-01-01 00:14:23: Just like the same key is the vocal slice that I've done once you know the key of
1970-01-01 00:14:29: The vocal you can obviously make melodies and what chords around
1970-01-01 00:14:34: That scale so yeah, that's what I've done. I'm using like a synth from Nexus because I use a lot of Nexus
1970-01-01 00:14:40: Give you guys my secret weapons and I use a lot of Nexus
1970-01-01 00:14:44: Synthesizers because I really warm
1970-01-01 00:14:47: Feel so they're always stacked up behind maybe roads when I use a lot of roads as well
1970-01-01 00:14:52: so
1970-01-01 00:14:53: Yeah, I've got that going on here
1970-01-01 00:15:11: If I was making this track properly it would have been
1970-01-01 00:15:15: Every single like drum sound would have been in separate channels so I can mix it down hopefully
1970-01-01 00:15:21: Just for the time sake I've just done it as one loop here
1970-01-01 00:15:27: It's a simple two-step groove
1970-01-01 00:15:29: bit offbeat as well
1970-01-01 00:15:31: and then I've got just a simple bass line to obviously marry the
1970-01-01 00:15:36: chords under drop obviously there's no chords
1970-01-01 00:15:45: Just simple and then obviously on the next bar
1970-01-01 00:15:51: I
1970-01-01 00:15:57: Had some order put like a little high string in there
1970-01-01 00:16:07: Yeah, I would have just built a little bit but yeah ten minutes, that's all I could do
